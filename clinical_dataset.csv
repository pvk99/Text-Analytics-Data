NCT04355065,The Secret Trail of Moon (Serious Videogame) and Chess on ADHD: a Clinal Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04355065,UNKNOWN,"Blackground:

Currently research on alternative forms of cognitive training in patients diagnosed with ADHD is gaining interest. Especially, the use of Virtual Reality video games. Our team has developed an innovative video game based on Virtual Reality, ""The Secret Trail of Moon (TSTM) as a cognitive tool to train 5 main areas of deficit in patients with ADHD. It is superiority study comparing TSTM with therapeutic chess and control group.

Methods:

This study is prospective, unicentric, randomized with a control group. 105 patients diagnosed with ADHD and pharmacologically stable, aged between 12 and 22 years. These patients will be randomized intro three groups: TSTM group (The Secret Trail of Moon); TC group (Therapeutic Chess) and CG (Control Group). Objective and subjective measures of the patient, parents and teachers will be included. Patients´visit will be different for each group. The TSTM group will have 15 face-to face visits: pre-inclusion visit, inclusion visit, 12 training visits and final visit. CT and GC group patients will have 3 face-to- face visits (pre-inclusion, initial visit and final visit) and 12 email or phone communications during training.

Discussion: This study aims to demonstrate the added efficacy of cognitive training to drug treatment. It is a study that tries to demonstrate the superiority of cognitive training with TSTM compared to a traditional cognitive training (TC) and a control group.

TSTM is presented as a new and powerful cognitive tool thanks to four factors that make it unique: the feeling of immersion in the scenarios, the variety of mechanics, the personalization and the playful aspect.",NO,Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity,BEHAVIORAL: Cognitive Traning with The Secret Trail of Moon|BEHAVIORAL: Cognitive Traning with Therapeutic Chess|DRUG: Control Group,Puerta de Hierro University Hospital,"Instituto de Salud Carlos III|Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, Spain|Gammera Nest Technology Company",INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2019-12-09
NCT00011466,Nutrient Intake in Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00011466,UNKNOWN,"Specific nutrient deficiencies have been described in children with ADHD including zinc, magnesium, calcium, and essential fatty acids. In addition, children with ADHD have been noted to behave and concentrate better in some studies when the ratio of protein compared with carbohydrate in their diets was increased, however, this was anecdotal information noted from studies designed to study other factors, so its not clear if the increased protein is actually the cause of the improved behavior. In our clinical practice, we have noted a high incidence of what appears to be carbohydrate ""craving"" among children with ADHD, which can put children at risk for obesity, diabetes type II, and additional dysregulation of mood and concentration. Carbohydrate craving is a well-documented phenomenon in adults, particularly those with certain patterns of obesity, mood disorders, or those undergoing smoking cessation programs. It has not been studied in children, however. Thus, this initial study was designed to determine 1) whether or not children with ADHD have different patterns of nutrient intake compared with children in the same family and children in families without a child with ADHD, 2) if the described nutrient deficiencies are due to decreased intake, and 3) whether there is an increased occurrence of carbohydrate craving, based on parents' perceptions, eating patterns, and actual intake, among children (or certain subgroups of children) with ADHD.

Behavioral parent training programs are a first-line evidence-based treatment for child disruptive behaviors. There is evidence showing that (a) these programs are effective in reducing disruptive behavior and improving long-term outcomes, and (b) there is an excellent return on investment for early intervention.

NCT00644566,Pilot Study of Shared Care of ADHD in a Pediatric Clinic:Colocation of a Psychologist as an ADHD Care Manager,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00644566,UNKNOWN,"Due to the shortage of child psychiatrists and the high prevalence of child mental health disorder, pediatricians and other pediatric primary care providers often assume responsibility for the management of various psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. However, pediatricians have not been well-trained during residency to deal with the complexities of ADHD management. In addition, the system of care under which pediatricians practice do not afford the time availability that is required to properly manage a child with ADHD. On the other hand, if a pediatrician wishes to refer a patient to a child mental health specialist, many obstacles, including but not limited to stigma, insurance issues, and long waiting lists, often interfere with the patient actually receiving services for his/her ADHD. This research project seeks to examine an innovative model of care in which a child psychologist is located on the premises of a pediatric office and is available to share the care of patients with the pediatrician in order to address ADHD. We hypothesize that parents as well as pediatricians will be more satisfied with this model of care and that patients will ultimately have better outcomes. The beginning of our pilot has shown under-identification to be a barrier to care as well, and thus we propose to implement a quality improvement initiative to screen children for psychosocial issues as well.

Children with ADHD struggle in school due to problems with attention and high levels of impulsivity and hyperactivity. They are at substantially increased risk for long-term difficulties into adulthood, including academic underachievement, substance abuse, and criminal behavior. The diagnosis of ADHD, which is based on subjective ratings by parents and teachers, likely results from multiple different, overlapping differences in circuits of the brain responsible for attention and impulse control. However, we do not have any scientific or clinical tests that allow us to understand these circuits. In an effort to improve ADHD outcomes, we have used a technology called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to identify highly reliable measurements of brain function. We have identified two very promising measures that are abnormal in children with ADHD and, importantly, also predict the severity of ADHD behaviors. The goal of this project is to determine if these two TMS measurements could be used to help better guide ADHD treatment. To do this, we will perform three investigations in 8 to 12 year old children to determine: 1) test-retest reliability; 2) pharmacologic responsiveness; and 3) correlations with two domains of function relevant to ADHD: ""Cognitive Control"" and ""Emotional Valence.""

NCT00573248,Nicotine and Behavior in Adult ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00573248,COMPLETED,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity that are frequently treated with stimulant medications such as Ritalin. Many people with ADHD smoke. The smoking prevalence rates are estimated to be 40% in adults with ADHD compared to 20% in the general population. People with ADHD have also more difficulty to quit smoking. Only 29% of smokers with ADHD quit smoking compared to 48.5% of smokers in the general population. Nicotine is a stimulant, which may have properties similar to stimulant medications (e.g., Ritalin) used to treat ADHD. Nicotine may increase attention and reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity and, thus, may regulate behavior in individuals with ADHD. Alleviating the symptoms of ADHD and increasing cardiovascular activity through smoking may mimic the effects of stimulant medications and can be a form of self-medication.

The major objective of the study was to examine the effects of nicotine on ADHD symptoms, moods, and cardiovascular activity. The study investigated the effects of nicotine patches on behavioral regulation in adult smokers and nonsmokers with ADHD. Smokers and nonsmokers with ADHD participated in two conditions: (1) nicotine patch and (2) placebo patch. During each condition, symptoms, moods, and side effects were assessed for 2 days during waking hours. An electronic handheld diary, programmed to prompt the participant twice per hour, recorded ADHD symptoms (e.g., difficulty concentrating, impulsivity, etc.), negative moods (e.g., anger, stress), and nicotine side effects (nausea, dizziness). Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded with lightweight ambulatory monitors to indicate cardiovascular activity. Results provided information about the effects of nicotine patches on behavioral regulation in adult smokers and nonsmokers with ADHD.

The inclusion of nonsmokers was important to clarify whether the effects of nicotine on smokers was due to smoking withdrawal. The findings help explain the increased smoking prevalence rates and reduced quit rates associated with ADHD. Knowledge about nicotine's effects on behavioral regulation can help to develop successful smoking cessation programs for individuals with ADHD. The findings on cardiovascular activity may help determine the potential risk for cardiovascular disease in smokers and nonsmokers with ADHD.

NCT01238822,Response Variability in Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01238822,COMPLETED,"Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have numerous areas of neuropsychological dysfunction including response inhibition, working memory, and attention. One neuropsychological outcome measure that consistently reveals between-group differences is response variability. However, until recently, differences in response variability have been reported as an ancillary finding or viewed as a nuisance in the analyses. The specific aims of the present study are to 1) Examine response variability in ADHD patients across neuropsychological tasks to understand the breadth of this specific deficit and to understand the relation between response variability and other neuropsychological outcome measures; 2) Assess whether response variability deficits are specific to either or both of the two most prevalent ADHD subtypes (i.e., Combined Type \[CT\] and Predominantly Inattentive Type \[PIT\]); 3) Determine whether response variability in ADHD patients is affected by either medication or a variety of environmental manipulations (e.g., reward); and 4) Understand the relationship between neuropsychological measures of response variability and naturalistic instances of variable performance. Forty-five children (aged 7-11) with ADHD-CT, 45 children with ADHD-PIT, and 45 normal controls will be recruited to examine response variability across a wide range of neuropsychological tests. Task parameters such as event rate, stimulus saliency, and the presence of operant reward will be modified on each test to determine the conditions under which response variability is manifested in children with ADHD. In addition, all children with ADHD will participate in a placebo-controlled, randomized medication trial with a psychostimulant medication to assess the effects of medication on response variability. Advanced analytic methods utilizing non-Gaussian distributions and fast Fourier Transforms of the reaction time data will be used to conduct detailed analyses of RT patterns across the ADHD and normal control groups. Further, the effects of task parametric manipulations and medication on response variability will be examined. Finally, relations between response variability on neuropsychological tests and response variability in a variety of real-world analog situations will be examined to evaluate the ecological validity of these deficits.",YES,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,DRUG: Methylphenidate|DRUG: placebo|DRUG: Methylphenidate|DRUG: Methylphenidate,"Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati",,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH",2006-06

The convention on the rights of the child became an institutional law in Sweden in 2020 and it emphasises that each child has the right to equal care and treatment. Therefore it is of importance to analyse how the variations in prescriptions rates arise and if we as healthcare providers can influence it. Our study is a collaboration between Region Skåne and the university of Lund and is a part of a larger study of the regional variations of prescriptions of ADHD drugs. Previous research informs us that a complex interplay of multiple factors can be behind variations in prescription rates among medical doctors and not the least subjective experiences and attitudes.

NCT05518435,Managing Young People With ADHD in Primary Care Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05518435,COMPLETED,"Background:

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common childhood neurodevelopmental disorder. It affects around 5% of children and adolescents, and up to 40% continue to experience symptoms into adulthood. Primary care practitioners (e.g., general practitioners (GPs), nurses, link workers, clinical pharmacists) play an important role in the healthcare of young people (YP) with ADHD, particularly due to long waiting times in adult mental health services, and patchy provision of specialist services. However, many practitioners feel unsure about how to support YP at this vulnerable stage in their lives. Practitioners report concerns about prescribing ADHD medication and a desire for more guidance. Currently, little is known about how YP with ADHD are supported in primary care, the strengths and weakness of existing care pathways, and how care can be improved.

Aims:

To provide an evidence-base by mapping current services, and co-produce guidance to improve and better co-ordinate primary care for YP aged 16-25 with ADHD.

Methods:

Three interlinked studies. A mapping study including a national survey of stakeholders to map patient pathways, prescribing practice, shared-care arrangements, and practitioner roles. A qualitative study including semi-structured interviews with YP and practitioners, to gain insight into experiences of 'what works' and 'what is needed'. Workshops to co-develop a map of patient pathways, key messages, and clinical guidance.

Patient Involvement:

This research has been developed in response to identified gaps in services, and requests from people with ADHD. The team includes young people with ADHD whose input will help ensure the research is sensitive and relevant, and an academic GP to ensure identified solutions are deliverable within primary care settings.

Impact:

The expected impact of this research is improvement of the quality and experience of care for YP with ADHD. Also, to improve experiences of primary care providers facing difficulties managing ADHD.",NO,ADHD,"OTHER: None, observational study",University of Exeter,,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2022-09-28

NCT01263548,To Evaluate the Safety and Metabolic Profile of Vyvanse for the Treatment of ADHD in Euthymic Adults With Bipolar I/II Disorder,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01263548,COMPLETED,"ADHD in the adult population is associated with several measures of harmful dysfunction. For example, adult ADHD is associated with high rates of separation/divorce and never-married status, lower educational attainment and occupational achievement, absenteeism, presenteeism, and job termination, as well as decreased social function. Individuals with adult ADHD are more likely than controls to have a comorbid diagnosis of bipolar disorder, alcohol and substance abuse, as well as antisocial personality disorder.

Psychostimulants are the most frequently employed medications in the treatment of adult ADHD. Several psychostimulants are Health Canada and US FDA-approved for the treatment of ADHD symptoms in adulthood.

Hitherto, no trial has evaluated the safety and efficacy of a psychostimulant in the treatment of ADHD symptomatology in adult individuals with bipolar disorder.

Vyvanse is the first prodrug stimulant indicated for the treatment of adult (and pediatric) ADHD. Vyvanse is a therapeutically inactive molecule (i.e. prodrug). After oral ingestion, lisdexamfetamine is converted to l-lysine, a naturally occurring essential amino acid, and active d-amphetamine, which is responsible for the drug's activity. Vyvanse provides a longer duration of effect consistent throughout the day with reduced potential for risk of abuse. Vyvanse is generally well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to other psychostimulant medications. Available evidence indicates that in most treated subjects, Vyvanse is weight-neutral and/or is associated with weight loss. Moreover, in some individuals, it is associated with improvement in both glucose and lipid homeostasis.

However, less is understood about how this relationship develops. It is these broad questions that this project seeks to address. First, what is the causal pathway? Does LD cause delinquency, delinquency cause LD, or are both caused by something else? And can big data analytics applied to statewide datasets of information about juvenile justice (JJ) involvement help to answer this question? Second, as it is known that learning to read and do math (and thus becoming more employable) increases the likelihood of desistance (i.e., not committing any more illegal acts), what are the necessary parts of an intervention designed to teach these skills? And what role might technology play in such an intervention? To answer these questions, we will implement a study that includes two components, (a) a big data component and (b) an intervention component. For (a), we will work with a large historical dataset from the Harris County Juvenile Probation Department. For (b), we will work, in total, with 192 (48 per year) delinquent youth with severe LD in residential placement.

This poor occupational performance at work may be partly caused by difficulties at executive functions (EF) abilities, and at the ability to set and attain goal directed work-activities at a satisfactory manner. Therefore, improvement at those abilities may followed by occupational performance at work enhancement of adults with ADHD. Such improvement may enhance adults with ADHD quality of life.

NCT02234557,Tai Chi Training for Children With ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02234557,COMPLETED,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has tremendous individual and societal impact, and the effectiveness of current standard treatments is limited. We examine a novel treatment that could remediate the core features of ADHD and thereby contribute to sustained improvements in behavioral control. This approach is motivated by mounting evidence that children with ADHD show difficulties with motor control, and that these motor deficits are strongly associated with the core behavioral features of ADHD. We employ Tai Chi, targeting improvements in well-established behavioral and physiologic measures of motor control, and with this, improvements in ADHD symptoms. The proposed study offers immense potential for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for ADHD with little risk of adverse reaction.

The over-arching goal of this proposal is to examine a movement-based mindfulness training as a therapeutic intervention for children with ADHD. This approach is motivated by two complimentary lines of evidence: 1) Children with ADHD show impairments in motor control that parallel (and correlate with) core deficits in behavioral control that define the disorder. 2) Gains in cognitive and behavioral control have been observed in adults learning Tai Chi, dance, or meditation. These lines of evidence provide substantial motivation for our proposed investigation of movement-based mindfulness training in children with ADHD. Specifically, we propose to evaluate an established Tai Chi-based intervention. We chose this approach for a number of reasons: 1) Tai Chi is among the most well-established movement-based interventions with documented therapeutic effects, including cognitive effects. 2) While many movement-based approaches show evidence of yielding cognitive improvements Tai Chi provides excellent opportunities for engagement of 8-12 year old children in the form of the collaborative game ""push hands."" 3) Tai Chi instruction consists of gentle movements that can be practiced even by those with physical limitations, and is readily available in the United States so the protocols developed in this study will be straightforward to deploy at a national level.

Hypothesis: After participating in a Tai Chi program, children with ADHD will show improvements in behavioral and physiologic measures of motor control.

It was found that type 2 macrophages (M2) have anti-inflammatory and neurorestorative potential, in contrast to pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic effects of М1 cells. The influence of M2 is largely realized through the production of a wide spectrum of bioactive factors (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, neuropeptides, microvesicles etc) that inhibit inflammation, protect neurons from apoptosis, stimulate neurogenesis, the growth and remyelination of axons, the formation of new synapses and activate angiogenesis.

The prevalence of ADHD among school children is reported to be 3%-11%. Children with ADHD have difficulties paying attention to details, concentrating, completing tasks and following instructions, among other social and academic challenges. In children with ADHD, insufficient activity in the prefrontal regions of the brain has been evidenced, which is linked to executive function skills. Such children have difficulties in performing executive functions that require a high level of cognitive skills, such as self-control and regulation, as well as sequencing and planning tasks. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) addresses executive dysfunction as a characteristic of ADHD. At the same time, 45%-70% of these children show problems in motor skills. Motor problems associated with ADHD, such as manual dexterity, bilateral coordination, and postural balance, can lead to difficulty in everyday living tasks, such as eating and writing, as well as social adaptability, academic skills, and peer interactions. For this reason, motor skill problems along with symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, should be addressed as part of the treatment strategy. ADHD has an impact on a child's independence for daily activities. As a result, child-specific occupational therapy approaches are critical for the sensory, motor, and cognitive areas that affect children's occupational performance in basic and instrumental activities of daily living, participation, rest and sleep, play, and leisure.",NO,Cognitive Orientation|Executive Dysfunction|Motor Activity,OTHER: COGNİTİVE ORİENTATİTON DAİLY OCCUPATİONAL PERFORMANCE APPROACH,Hacettepe University,,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2020-03-01

NCT05142826,Investigation of Strategies to Reduce the Impact of the Relative Age Effect in Kindergarten,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05142826,RECRUITING,"There is now clear evidence that children entering kindergarten, that are relatively young for the grade (e.g., born in the months immediately preceding the school entry cut-off) are at significantly more risk for receiving an ADHD diagnosis and being prescribed stimulant medication. These risks appear to be related solely to age of entry when other explanatory variables are controlled. This situation, termed the ""Relative Age Effect""has potentially serious consequences for kindergarten children (e.g., greater likelihood of being prescribed psychoactive medication to control behavior).

The present proposal aims to develop a teacher intervention to attenuate the impact of the relative age effect on young kindergarteners with elevated ADHD symptoms, and test the correspondence between the hypothesized mechanisms and treatment outcomes related to ADHD (e.g., symptoms, impairment). Following intervention development and refinement, 60 children entering kindergarten in the fall, and young for the grade, will be randomly assigned to (1) Kindergarten as Usual (KAU); (2) a Relative Age Effect prevention intervention administered immediately; or (3) a Relative Age Effect prevention intervention administered mid-year. In the intervention groups, teachers will be introduced to the relative age effect, receive information on how to anchor behavioral ratings in developmental norms, and implement a positive behavioral support to support growth in the child across the kindergarten school year.

Primary aims will be to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention approach as well as the ability of the team to retain young children in a longitudinal trial. Further, the hypothesized mechanisms (e.g., improved neurocognitive functioning; improved teacher use of positive behavioral supports) will be measured and correspondence to hypothesized outcomes (e.g., reduced ADHD symptoms and impairment) will be evaluated. Anticipated benefits include attenuation of any negative effects for children who receive intervention, and risks include breach of confidentiality and worsening of symptoms initially if an intervention is instituted. The knowledge to be gained is important as it could reduce untoward outcomes for the relatively youngest children in the grade.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,BEHAVIORAL: Relative Age Effect Intervention|OTHER: School as Usual,Florida International University,University at Buffalo|National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2022-06-01
NCT05832957,The Effectiveness of Cognitive-Functional Intervention to Reduce Driving Risk Factors of Adolescents With ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05832957,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with a high risk for driving accidents. Adolescents with ADHD are 1.2 to 4 times more prone to be involved in car accidents. Driving accidents are the leading cause of death among adolescents.

Objective: Examining a multidimensional applied intervention based on serious gaming principles to improve the driving capabilities and skills of adolescents with ADHD Methodology: The study will include 90 adolescents (aged 15-18 years old) with ADHD diagnosis who did not yet start driving lessons. Participants will undergo a stratified randomized clinical trial, single-blinded. The stratified randomization process will include gender, age, and medication status. There exist three different intervention modalities: (1) A personalized cognitive-functional intervention- 'Drive-Fun' (group1) (2) educational intervention (group2); and (3) no intervention (group3). Meetings will entail 11 once-a-week sessions. Participants will be evaluated before intervention (baseline), after the intervention, and at a 6-month follow-up. Evaluations will include simulated driving skills, meta-cognitive abilities, eye tracking, and brain activity (EEG) measures. The evaluation and the intervention will be conducted by two certified occupational therapists. Participants and the therapist performing the evaluations will be blinded to group type and intervention.

The potential scientific contribution of the proposed research: Given the great risks of injury to adolescents with ADHD and other road users, it is important to identify dangerous driving behaviors as well as develop methods that can lead to better driving skills and a safer driving experience. It is anticipated that evidence will be presented by the evaluation battery that the personalized intervention program developed will significantly improve potential driving skills on the simulator and hopefully also actual driving.",NO,Driving Risk Factors Among Adolescents With ADHD,BEHAVIORAL: Drive fun|BEHAVIORAL: educational intervention|OTHER: No intervention,Tel Aviv University,,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2023-02-02

Among the different clinical forms of instability, ADHD appears to be an especially disabling condition for the development of the child, both in psychomotor, cognitive, emotional and relational aspects. Further, a significant link between ADHD children and some children with High Potential (HP) is observed. HP children show overall ahead cognitive developments compared to children with the same age. In these children, as well as in children with ADHD, an attention vulnerability, psychomotor deficits are noted, as well as emotional and relational deficits that significantly contrasted with some of their cognitive skills. Regarding the HP, the hypothesis is that children with significantly heterogeneous results (Complex) to the Wechsler IV scales are affected by this shift, and hence, by the difficulty of a differential diagnosis with ADHD, unlike those whose intelligence quotient (IQ) results that are more homogeneous (Laminar).

The goal of this work was to study a population of 80 children aged from 8 to 12 years (20 subjects per group) to evaluate the functional and structural brain development by:

* Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquisitions with cognitive stimulations, involving attention, working memory and semantic processing, and emotional stimulations,
* fMRI acquisitions at rest (without activation),
* diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) acquisitions,
* 3D anatomic acquisitions. Identification of developmental differences in certain cortical brain areas (eg, prefrontal vs parietal), white matter fiber bundles or functional networks preferentially used by one or other of these groups, will help to better understand this disease, and to improve the differential diagnosis in order to implement a more appropriate and personalized management of the patients via new therapeutic strategies.",NO,ADHD,OTHER: MRI|OTHER: neuropsychological assessment,Hospices Civils de Lyon,,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,2013-05

In the proposed study, 300 adolescents with ADHD who present for treatment at one of four community mental health agencies in Miami-Dade County, FL will be randomly assigned to STAND or agency usual care (UC). Participating agency therapists also will be randomly assigned to deliver STAND or UC. STAND therapists will receive a comprehensive treatment manual, three-day training, and weekly supervision from a project psychologist. Participants will be screened by research staff in the community setting and enrolled on a rolling basis over 30 months. Participants will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and three-month follow-up. In line with RDoC, multi-method measures will be obtained for treatment outcome (family and academic impairment), treatment mediators (executive functioning, parent academic involvement, parent-teen communication, parent/adolescent motivation, ADHD symptoms), and moderators of effectiveness (patient, practitioner, service delivery, and organization characteristics). Additional consumer perspective (satisfaction, therapeutic alliance) and agency fit (therapist competence, treatment fidelity, need for additional treatment, attendance, therapist attitude toward treatment, cost effectiveness) measures will also be obtained to evaluate effectiveness.

NCT05383430,Prevalence of Stuttering in Children With ADHD at Sohag University Hospital,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05383430,UNKNOWN,"The majority of the latest research suggests that stuttering is associated with significantly elevated levels of trait and social anxiety. The prevalence of children who stutter and have attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) ranges from 4 to 26%. About 10-20% of children who stutter might show ADHD.

Gender ( male) is the dominant risk factor for stuttering, as also applies to other neurodevelopmental disorders. Examples include attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, tics and the Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS). These neurodevelopmental disorders are the second -most prominent set of comorbidities with stuttering.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and stuttering share many characteristics in addition to temperament . A complex interplay of neural differences, with genetic and environmental components, has been reported as a possible cause of both disorders. In addition, both may appear more frequently in boys than in girls . Furthermore, it is emphasized that childhood stuttering can be accompanied by aspects of ADHD . Likewise, children exhibiting signs of ADHD more frequently display speech disfluencies than their peers.

It is suggested that children with stuttering and those without stuttering will display different profiles in terms of temperament, certain aspects of ADHD, and some types of anxiety. In addition, it is to be expected that there will be some correlations between these variables in children who stutter. However, it is not possible to draw definite conclusions about this issue that could be generalized to all children who stutter.

NCT03144739,Collaborative Care for Children's Mental Health Problems,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03144739,COMPLETED,"Background: Mental health problems cause a disproportionate burden of disability among children and youth compared to adults. Primary care plays an important role in efforts to prevent and intervene early in the course of child and adolescent mental health problems. While research with adults has shown the feasibility of integrating mental health care into primary care settings, there have been few studies among children and youth. Evidence remains lacking that integration is feasible in diverse settings, that it improves outcomes, and that methods can be developed to address the mixed symptoms of emerging child/youth problems and their overlap with developmental and parental disorders.

Goals: The purpose of this project is to test the effectiveness of adding a child/youth mental health component into an existing collaborative care program for adult mental health problems. The work will refine a framework for efficient cultural adaption and tailoring of an existing child/youth primary care mental health intervention and then test whether the tailored intervention results in improved child and parent outcomes. The work will also provide evidence about the mechanisms by which those outcomes are achieved and what factors influence uptake of the child/youth component by general practitioners (GPs). These results should be generalizable to low and middle income countries and to underserved areas of the US where there are minimal child mental health resources and family physicians provide the bulk of medical care for children and youth.

Methods: The planned work involves the adaptation/tailoring process followed by a trial with 45 GPs already engaged in collaborative care for adults; the trial will study adding collaborative care for children ages 5-15. GPs will be randomly assigned in groups to begin 6-month control periods involving child mental health screening and referral. They will then receive child/youth training and begin second 6-month periods of screening plus ongoing coaching and booster sessions and collaborative management. Primary outcomes will be measured by recruiting and following for 6 months two cohorts of children/youth and their parents (one control, one collaborative care). Data collected from GPs, parents, youth, and the collaborative care data system will allow measurement of key factors that determine the program's success in helping children and families.",NO,Depression|Anxiety|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|Oppositional Defiant Disorder|Parent-Child Relations|Substance Use,OTHER: Training in management of children's mental health problems|OTHER: Current collaborative care protocol,Johns Hopkins University,National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,2017-08-01

The children were between 7-12 years of age. Most of them were treated with stimulant medication, (i.e. methylphenidate) to help reduce hyperactivity; however, both the parents and children needed special help to develop some techniques for behavioural management.

Meditation has been used as an attention training method for many thousands of years, and was mostly involved with religious or spiritual practices in various parts of the world, especially in the eastern countries. Breathing meditation is a popular method which can be applied to all people without instructions that are too complicated.

NCT06142786,Individualized Alpha Neurofeedback for ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06142786,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders, characterised by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Although pharmacotherapy is considered the first-line treatment for ADHD at all ages (at least for severe cases), non-pharmacological therapies might be equally effective without the risk of drug side effects. Some studies have shown that electroencephalographic (EEG) neurofeedback improves parent-rated ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents. However, whether neurofeedback is an effective treatment for ADHD is still under debate.

Several issues may hinder the evaluation of the effectiveness of neurofeedback treatment in previous studies. Firstly, previous neurofeedback studies did not utilize effective neurophysiological markers for ADHD. Theta/Beta ratio, the most common neurofeedback marker for treating ADHD in the past two decades, has recently been suggested to be only weakly correlated to individuals' attention. Secondly, previous studies mostly used the norm of the EEG markers in age/gender matched healthy children as the training target for ADHD children, which largely ignored the individual variations in EEG acquisition. Third, most of the previous studies lack a rigorous study design, for comparing neurofeedback with a 'placebo' condition and evaluating its specific and non-specific effects.

In the current studies, we propose to conduct a sham-controlled, triple-blind trial to evaluate the effectiveness of an individual-based neurofeedback treatment for ADHD children and adolescents. The EEG marker for neurofeedback in treating ADHD would be the individualized lower/higher alpha band power, based on the recent methodological advances in EEG spectrum processing (1/f model fit and individualized peak alpha frequency modelling) . The training target will be individualized and defined according to the neurophysiological pattern shown in pre-training resting-state conditions, and thus each participant will be trained to achieve their own optimum state of engagement. Sham neurofeedback will be used as a placebo condition, controlling for the non-specific effect of neurofeedback. The study will be triple-blinded (i.e, participants, individuals who administered treatment or intervention, and those who assessed the outcomes were masked).",NO,ADHD,BEHAVIORAL: attenuating individualized lower alpha neurofeedback|BEHAVIORAL: Sham neurofeedback,The University of Hong Kong,,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",2024-06-01

NCT05935722,Evaluation of a Home-based Parenting Support Program: Parenting Young Children,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05935722,RECRUITING,"Background: Parents with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) have a tendency to provide insufficient caregiving and often need parenting support to prevent neglect and child removal. However, parents with IDDs are not provided with appropriate support, and there is a lack of evidence-based programmes tailored to these parents' needs. Parenting Young Children (PYC) is a home-based parenting programme developed for parents with IDDs. PYC has shown promising clinical results in interview-based studies, but there is no evidence of its effectiveness. The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the PYC programme for improving parenting in parents with IDDs where there is risk of child neglect. The study will include a quantitative evaluation, a process evaluation, and a qualitative evaluation of the children's and parents' perspectives on participating in PYC.

Methods: The quantitative evaluation will have a multi-centre, non-randomised, comparative study design. Eligible for participation are parents with IDDs who have children aged 0-9 years living at home and who are assessed as needing tailored parenting support. Thirty parents receiving PYC and thirty parents receiving treatment as usual (TAU) will be recruited from Swedish municipal social services. Outcome variables will be examined before and after the intervention, with a follow-up 6 months after completing the intervention. The primary outcome will be goal-attainment in parenting skills, and secondary outcomes will be parental self-efficacy and children's wellbeing. Interview methods will be used to explore the perspectives of parents and children in the PYC group.

Discussion: This study is motivated by the need for evidence-based support for parents with IDDs, and it focuses on upholding the centrality of child-caregiver relationships and family preservation, as well as children's rights and the rights of people with disabilities. Social services have expressed ethical concerns with employing a randomized design for this vulnerable group, and this study will therefore evaluate PYC in a non-randomized comparative study.",NO,Intellectual Disability|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|Autism Spectrum Disorder,BEHAVIORAL: Parenting Young Children|BEHAVIORAL: Treatment as Usual,"Örebro University, Sweden",Linkoeping University|Mälardalen University|Stockholm University|Uppsala University|Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2022-09-08

For adults, the evidence is deficient and there is a great need to investigate whether adults have the same effect on ADHD symptoms of physical exercise, as children and young people have. Adults with ADHD often have a sedentary lifestyle and suffer from obesity and have sleep problems. In a normal population, these problems have been shown to be affectable with physical exercise. START (Support in Activity, Movement and Exercise) is a randomized controlled intervention study where physical exercise is given for 12 weeks, with or without cognitive support. The effect is measured with rating scales as well as cognitive and physical tests. The purpose is to investigate whether START works as a treatment for ADHD in terms of ADHD symptoms and disability, and what impact the intervention has on mental health, physical condition and activity level, body awareness and everyday functioning.

Outcome measures are registered within 3 weeks before and after the end of treatment, after 6 months and 12 months.

These guidelines can be challenging to implement in typical community-based practices. Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) has developed a program called the ADHD Collaborative to promote the adoption of these guidelines among community pediatricians. The program focuses on modifying the office system using academic detailing and quality improvement (QI) methodology to accommodate prescribed practice changes. The ADHD Collaborative has been very successful at recruiting practices in the Greater Cincinnati area, changing practice behaviors, and sustaining these practice behaviors over time at minimal cost to the project and to the office practice. Now that sustainability and effectiveness have been established, the next step is to modify the ADHD Collaborative model to make it amenable to widespread dissemination. The primary goal of the proposed study is to modify the ADHD Collaborative intervention to make it transportable and then evaluate this version in terms of effectiveness, consumer satisfaction, and costs.. A transportable intervention is described that utilizes telehealth videoconferencing, a web portal, and long-distance data collection. Initially, three pediatric practices will be recruited to test and refine the distal intervention delivery methodology. Then, eight new pediatric practices will be randomly assigned to receive the distal intervention or to a control group (treatment as usual). Information about pediatric practice behavior will be collected at baseline, 6-months, and 1-year post-baseline.

NCT01595568,Prevention and Reduction of Alcohol and Drug Problems in a Clinical Psychiatric Youth Population,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01595568,UNKNOWN,"In adolescents, mental health problems are frequently associated with substance misuse, even considered a risk factor for alcohol abuse and dependence. This dual diagnosis tends to complicate the patient's treatment and prognosis by increasing, among others, substance use problems, reckless behaviours, relationships and school problems and suicidal thoughts. It is therefore critical to invest time and effort into developing an efficient approach to prevent and reduce substance use problems and offer these children a more global and optimal treatment.

A brief personality-targeted intervention was developed with students of Canadian and English high schools based on four personality factors known to be implicated in the vulnerability to adolescent alcohol misuse (Impulsivity, Anxiety Sensitivity, Negative Thinking and Sensation Seeking) (Conrod et al., 2006,2008, O'Leary-Barrett 2010).

By helping the adolescents to develop better adaptive behaviours, this cognitive-behavioural intervention proved to reduce binge drinking, quantity and frequency of use and substance use problems (Conrod et al., 2006,2011).

The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of this intervention if combined to a regular treatment in a youth psychiatric population.

60 patients aged 14-17 years of a Child and Adolescent psychiatric department will be screened for personality risk with self-report assessments including the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale. Participants will be randomly assigned to a personality matched cognitive-behavioural intervention or a no-intervention control.

The main outcome measures of this study are alcohol and illicit drug outcomes.

NCT01352468,Development of a Multi-faceted Cognitive Training Program for Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01352468,COMPLETED,"After decades of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) intervention research, only two intervention approaches (i.e., psychopharmacology, behavioral treatment) have a ""well-established"" evidence-base supporting their efficacy for children with ADHD. Both of these interventions have inherent limitations. Recently multiple studies have demonstrated that cognitive training may improve neuropsychological and behavioral functioning in children with ADHD. The magnitude of treatment effects for cognitive training has been comparable to treatment effects for behavioral treatment for ADHD (i.e., small to moderate effect sizes). A limitation of existing cognitive training programs that may limit their efficacy is that each has employed a unifaceted approach. Each intervention program has targeted a single cognitive domain (e.g., working memory). This is problematic since as a group, children with ADHD have multiple areas of cognitive deficit (i.e., working memory, attention, response inhibition, delay aversion, intra-individual variability) and thus a unifaceted intervention does not address the multifaceted array of cognitive dysfunction in children with ADHD. Also, because individuals with ADHD each have unique patterns of cognitive deficits, a unifaceted cognitive training approach may target areas which are non-deficient and miss areas of significant deficit in individual patients depending on their ideographic cognitive profile. The primary goal of the proposed research is to develop and test a multifaceted cognitive training intervention that addresses a comprehensive array of ADHD-related cognitive deficits thereby ensuring that children's unique areas of cognitive deficit are targeted. During Phase I (R21 grant), software and a manual will be developed consisting of four training tasks targeting response inhibition, verbal working memory, attention, and delay aversion. Each task will possess advancing levels of difficulty. On each task, children will receive feedback on performance accuracy as well as on intra-individual variability in reaction times. The software will be pilot tested in Phase I to determine performance thresholds and intervention duration. Also, focus groups will be conducted to obtain patient perceptions of each task's difficulty and interest level. In Phase II (R33 grant), a preliminary randomized clinical trial will be conducted in order to obtain initial estimates of treatment efficacy. Pre-, post-, and follow up outcomes will be collected on a wide range of neuropsychological, behavioral, and academic measures.

The study is designed to identify the effects of 10 controlled soccer headings in college-aged soccer players diagnosed with ADHD and without ADHD, through the use of neural-injury blood biomarkers, functional and diffusion MRI, and ocular-motor function across three acute timepoints. The central hypothesis is that neuronal structural, physiological, and functional impairments from subconcussive head impacts will be amplified by ADHD. The neural-injury blood biomarkers neurofilament light (NF-L), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCHL-1), and Tau will be measured in plasma, with the hypothesis that 10 soccer headings will significantly increase plasma NF-L levels in both groups at 24h post-heading compared to baseline, but this increase will be higher in the ADHD group; plasma UCH-L1, GFAP, and Tau levels will increase significantly after 10 headings in the ADHD group at 2h and 24h post-heading, but levels in the non-ADHD group will remain consistent throughout the time points. It is also hypothesized that repetitive subconcussive head impacts will impair neurocognitive function, as measured by regional changes in fMRI activation during working memory and attention-based tasks, in the ADHD group. Ten headings will significantly alter fMRI activation in the ADHD group from baseline. This impairment will not be observed in the non-ADHD group, rather the non-ADHD group will show consistent fMRI activation even after 10 headings. White matter microstructure will be measured by diffusion imaging metrics, with the hypothesis that 10 soccer headings will significantly disrupt microstructure in the ADHD group compared to baseline, but not in the non-ADHD group. The study will also assess neuro-ophthalmologic function as measured by the King-Devick test (KDT) and oculomotor function as measured by the near-point-of-convergence (NPC) in response to subconcussive head impacts. The hypothesis is that NPC performance will be significantly impaired and persist for longer than 24 hours in both groups, but this impairment will be greater in the ADHD group, and that the learning curve and expected improvement of KDT will be significantly blunted in both groups, with a display of worsening in the ADHD group.",NO,Sport Injury|Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,OTHER: Soccer Heading|OTHER: Soccer Heading,Indiana University,,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: OTHER",2021-03-15

NCT01143701,Evaluation of an Intervention for Improving Community-based Pediatric Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Care,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01143701,COMPLETED,"ADHD is the most prevalent mental health disorder of childhood. The majority of children with ADHD receive their care in primary care settings. While the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued evidence-based guidelines and recommendations for pediatricians, most pediatricians have difficulty adhering to these guidelines. Given observed deficiencies in evidence-based ADHD care and the likely effects on child outcomes, the development and testing of interventions aimed at improving ADHD care in primary care settings is necessary. Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center has developed a model intervention, termed the ADHD Collaborative, to comprehensively address this issue. The ADHD Collaborative intervention model includes academic detailing, quality improvement methods, and innovative tools (e.g., web portal) designed to promote and support the systematic use of the AAP guidelines. This intervention model has been used to train over 200 physicians at 55 practices in the Greater Cincinnati area. The intervention appears to produce 2- to 4-fold increases in the use of evidence-based ADHD-related practice behaviors in participating physicians. To date, the intervention has been implemented as a quality improvement project with few experimental controls. The primary goal of the proposed study is to conduct an experimentally-controlled cluster randomized trial of the ADHD Collaborative intervention. Thirty-two pediatric practices will be randomly assigned to receive the ADHD Collaborative intervention or to provide usual care. Approximately 96 physicians and 576 of their ADHD patients will be included in the study. Chart reviews, parental interviews, and parent and teacher rating scales will be collected. Between- and within-group hierarchical linear modeling analyses will examine whether the intervention produces significant improvements in pediatrician practice behaviors, patient satisfaction with ADHD care, and child outcomes over and above typical ADHD care.

It also aims to explore the effectiveness of self-compassion intervention on enhancing self-compassion and psychological well-being of children with AD/HD in Hong Kong. The study will contribute to the current understanding of the supportive measures for children with AD/HD, and hopefully help to mobilize more resources to preserve children with AD/HD's mental health.

The intervention program includes the following components:

Participants will be randomly assigned to the self-compassion intervention group or the waitlist control group. The intervention group consists of two parts: children training session and parent group sessions. All children participants will complete a total of 6 training sessions, and each session will last around 90 minutes. Parents of the children participants will also complete a total of 3 group sessions, and each session will last around 90 minutes.

To investigate the intervention effectiveness, children will be asked to complete a questionnaire assessing their levels of self-compassion, emotional regulation, as well as psychological well-being in terms of life satisfaction, positive and negative affect. Parents and teachers of participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire covering children's emotional regulation, positive and negative affect. Questionnaire data collection will be conducted prior to the intervention (i.e., Time 1), immediately after the 6-session student and 3-session parent sessions (i.e., Time 2), and 2 months after the intervention (i.e., Time 3, a 2-month follow up).

NCT01107301,Vascular Effects of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Medications in Youth,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01107301,COMPLETED,"4.4 million children and adolescents in the United States have been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and more than half are treated with medication. Most ADHD medications are stimulants, which activate the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). SNS activation is closely associated with vascular functional and mechanical abnormalities. Therefore, ADHD medications, via instigating SNS activation and altering the hemodynamic profile, may have untoward effects on the vasculature and increase risk of developing cardiovascular disease in children and adolescents who use them.

Our overall objective in this study is to determine whether ADHD medication use is associated SNS activation, endothelial dysfunction, and arterial stiffness in children and adolescents. We will address this objective by conducting a case-control study and obtain non-invasive measures of SNS activation, endothelial function, and arterial stiffness in children and adolescents (8-17 years old) with (using stimulant medication) and without ADHD.",NO,ADHD,,University of Minnesota,,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2010-01
NCT01099072,Carnitine as an Adjunct to Methylphenidate for the Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01099072,UNKNOWN,"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioural disorder of childhood. The investigators hypothesized that carnitine would be beneficial for treatment of ADHD, and this could be evaluated in a double blind, randomized, parallel group comparison of carnitine+methylphenidate and methylphenidate +placebo.

This will be a six-week, parallel group, randomized clinical trial undertaken in an outpatient child and adolescent clinic at Roozbeh Psychiatric Hospital in Tehran, Iran during April 2010-May 2010.

40 male and female subjects, ages 6 to 17 years with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnosis of ADHD will be study population of this trial. At screening, investigators conduct a psychiatric evaluation with the DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD and the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime diagnostic interview and perform a complete medical history and physical examination.

The diagnosis of ADHD will be confirmed by a child and adolescent psychiatrist before participants will be initiated into the study. All patients will be newly diagnosed. Parents were carefully interview and ask to rate the severity of the DSM-IV-TR ADHD symptoms that their children display at home. Children will be excluded if they have a history or current diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders, schizophrenia or other psychiatric disorders(DSM-IV axis I); any current psychiatric comorbidity that required pharmacotherapy; any evidence of suicide risk and mental retardation (I.Q. \<70). In addition, patients will be excluded if they have a clinically significant chronic medical condition, including organic brain disorder, seizures and, current abuse or dependence on drugs within 6 months. Additional exclusion criteria will be hypertension, hypotension. To participate, parents and children have to be willing to comply with all requirements of the study. After a description of the procedures and purpose of the study, written informed consent will be obtained from each patient's parent or guardian. Informed consent will receive before the administration of any study procedure or dispensing of study medication in accordance with the ethical standards of the investigative site's institutional review board and with the Helsinki declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. The protocol will be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

Patients will be randomized to receive a carnitine+methylphenidate and methylphenidate +placebo in a 1: 1 ratio using a computer-generated code.

All study subjects will be randomly assigned to receive treatment using methylphenidate at a dose of 20-30 mg/day depending on weight (20 mg/day for \<30 Kg and 30 mg/day for \>30 Kg)+ Carnitine 500-1500 mg/day (depending on weight ) or methylphenidate at a dose of 20-30 mg/day depending on weight (20 mg/day for \<30 Kg and 30 mg/day for \>30 Kg)+ Placebo for a 6 week double blind, randomized clinical.

The principal measure of outcome will be the Parent and Teacher ADHD Rating Scale-IV that has been used extensively in Iran in school-age children and provides valid measures of behavioral abnormality and attention trial.

Effective early treatments that account for ADHD symptoms have not been developed for young children with ASD+ADHD. The overarching goals of this randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2, pilot study are to (1) evaluate a novel early intervention that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms while providing an ASD-targeted behavioral intervention, and (2) identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie improved outcomes in children with comorbid ASD and ADHD ages 3-10 years. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether a stimulant treatment augments efficacy of an ASD specific form of parent child therapy based on the Early Start Denver Model called ESDM influenced Parent Coaching. Secondary aims are to determine the efficacy of combined intervention in improving ADHD symptoms and the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Adzenys-XR-ODT in young children with ASD+ADHD. The study will also examine correlations between behavioral changes and state-of-the-art eye-gaze tracking (EGT) and electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers to elucidate key ways in which ADHD impacts attentional and neural functioning in ASD+ADHD, and to potentially identify new targets for intervention in children with ASD+ADHD. The study is about 8 months long and will involve screening, baseline assessment followed by 10- 11 weeks of study drug treatment (active or placebo) and 8 sessions of ESDM informed parent coaching beginning after 2 weeks of study drug treatment, primary endpoint assessments at \~11 weeks, AE follow-up by phone at \~week 13 and remote FU 24 weeks after baseline.

NCT03104972,Non-invasive Brain Stimulation for Pediatric ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03104972,COMPLETED,"The possibility of influencing brain activity and steadily enhancing behavioral performance through external intervention has long fascinated neuroscientists. One of these techniques, transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), has received great interest. Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) in the current research includes two types of stimulation: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS).

The tES techniques involve the application of constant weak direct current (e.g. 1-2 mA) to the brain via skin-electrode interface, creating electric field that modulates neuronal activity. The safety profile of tES is excellent.

Despite effective pharmacotherapy for ADHD there is a need for improvement of cognitive dysfunction and behavioral symptoms that are only inadequately covered by pharmacological or psycho-social interventions. Since ADHD is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood with significant negative lifetime outcomes, non-invasive brain stimulation methods have been investigated in childhood and adolescents neuropsychiatric disorders showing promising results.

If tES is significantly effective for certain symptoms of ADHD, it may offer many advantages as a therapy. Treatment of ADHD with non-invasive brain stimulation has recently been reviewed in the medical literature, concluding that this technique seems to have efficacy in ADHD, however, standardized study protocols are needed to determine it.

In this study we intend to further examine the efficacy of tDCS and tRNS for children with ADHD and its effect on ADHD symptoms, memory, executive functions, in a randomized controlled crossover study.",NO,ADHD,DEVICE: tDCS|DEVICE: tRNS|DEVICE: sham,Hebrew University of Jerusalem,,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2018-02-01

NCT00918567,Impact of Strattera and Behavior Therapy on the Home and School Functioning of Children With ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00918567,COMPLETED,"Background: Multiple studies have found Atomoxetine (Strattera) to be efficacious but there is only one published study specifically designed to evaluate its efficacy in school settings. In this 7 week placebo-controlled study, Atomoxetine (ATX) at mean dose of 1.3 mg/kg, significantly reduced teacher rated ADHD symptoms (Weiss et al., 2005). However, children are typically referred for treatment because of ""real life"" problems in functioning, not symptoms (Pelham, Fabiano, \& Massetti, 2005). While ATX has been found to produce functional improvements at home, the Weiss study found limited results in this area at school.

Furthermore, almost no research has examined the effects of combining ATX and behavior therapy (BT). In the MTA, adding BT to stimulants improved teacher ratings of hyperactivity/impulsivity and increased the number of subjects reaching optimal response (Swanson et al., 2001). Therefore, it is possible that the addition of BT to ATX may improve functional performance in the classroom. The effects of combined therapy may be even larger for ATX as monotherapy with nonstimulants produces smaller effect sizes than with stimulants.

Objective: The primary objective was to evaluate the effects of ATX alone and in combination with BT on the school functioning of 56 children ages 6-12 with ADHD. Outcomes were assessed using traditional symptoms measures as well as functional measures of academic and behavioral improvements in the classroom.",YES,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,DRUG: atomoxetine|BEHAVIORAL: Behavior Modification Therapy,State University of New York at Buffalo,Eli Lilly and Company,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2007-01

NCT04318067,Melatonin in ADHD and Sleep Problems,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04318067,RECRUITING,"Treatment with melatonin is often initiated on an insufficient basis as it has not been established prior to starting the treatment whether or not the child had delayed release of endogenous melatonin. At the clinic, it has furthermore been observed that the length of time a child experiences an effect of melatonin treatment varies substantially.

In a clinical context, treatment with melatonin is used increasingly (www.Medstat.dk). However, there is no tradition in Denmark for measuring the endogenous melatonin level before initiating such treatment. Hence there is no way of knowing to what extent the sleep problems were indeed caused by delayed melatonin release.

There seem to be no studies on the difference in the effect of melatonin treatment of children and adolescents depending on whether or not they have delayed DLMO. Likewise, there are no studies including adolescents.

As can be seen, it is important to gain more knowledge about the normal release of melatonin, and the release of melatonin in a group of children and adolescents with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses. It is also essential to investigate whether there are any differences in the release of melatonin in children and adolescents with chronic sleep onset problem and children and adolescents who do not have sleep problems.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|Sleep Disorder,DRUG: Melatonin 3 mg,Allan Hvolby,Sygehus Lillebaelt,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2020-09-01

Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the investigators have found that the volumes of certain brain regions are reduced in patients with ADHD. The reduced volumes were much less pronounced if patients had been treated with stimulant medications, suggesting that stimulants may reduce the symptoms of ADHD by reversing these volume reductions. In a second and related study, the investigators found that in patients with ADHD, emotional processing was normalized when patients were taking stimulant medications. Both studies point to possible mechanisms by which stimulants are effective; however, a significant limitation of these findings is that they were derived from cross-sectional studies.

In this current study, the investigators hope to replicate these treatment effects of stimulants in a prospective, controlled manner.

NCT04732572,"Brain Tissue Integrity and Autonomic Function Alterations in Childhood OSA and ADHD, and After Adenotonsillectomy.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04732572,UNKNOWN,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are two common, severe disorders in children. Unfortunately, pediatric OSA is closely associated with ADHD, and both diseases can cause cognitive impairment, behavior problems, and low academic performance. OSA can damage the brain and induce autonomic dysfunction, and then cause cognitive, behavioral, and quality-of-life problems. The presence of ADHD can further exacerbate these adverse effects of OSA. Therefore, the identification of robust biomarkers of OSA and ADHD is a key imperative to facilitate early identification of the pathological features and mechanisms and to optimize the treatment of OSA and ADHD for the pediatric population. Diffusion MRI of the brain is one of the most widely used technology for assessment of brain tissue integrity and heart rate variability is one of the most widely used measurements of autonomic function. However, the effects of ADHD and adenotonsillectomy on MRI and HRV biomarkers in children with OSA have not been reported. We hypothesize that comorbid ADHD can deteriorate brain damage and autonomic dysfunction, and adenotonsillectomy can reverse these alternations in children with OSA. The aims of this study are (1) to investigate the differences in pediatric brain tissue integrity, autonomic function, attention, behavior, quality-of-life, and sleep factors between the 'OSA with ADHD', 'OSA without ADHD', and 'healthy control' group; (2) to evaluate the efficacy of adenotonsillectomy versus watchful waiting with supportive care, with respect to the same variables of interest; (3) to evaluate whether the relative efficacy of the treatment differs according to baseline ADHD, weight, or OSA severity; and (4) to develop a predictive model for surgical success rate using both conventional well-known factors and MRI/HRV biomarkers. This is a 3-year prospective study that includes two parts. The Part I study is a cross-sectional study recruiting 100 children (5 to 9 years of age) to investigate the differences in brain tissue integrity (voxel-based morphometry and fractional anisotropy; assessed by structure MRI \[T1\] for volumetric alternations of gray and white matter, resting-state functional MRI for functional connectivity, and diffusion MRI for white matter integrity), autonomic function (time-domain and frequency-domain analyses; assessed by a wearable, real-time HRV measurement), severity pf attentive and behavioral problems (assessed by the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham IV-Teacher and Parent Rating Scale), quality-of-life (assessed by OSA-18), and sleep factors (apnea-hypopnea index, obstructive apnea index, arousal index, mean and least oxygen saturation, and sleep stage; assessed by polysomnography) between the OSA with ADHD group (Study Group 1; n = 40), the OSA without ADHD group (Study Group 2; n = 40), and the healthy control group (Control Group; n = 20). The Part II study is a randomized controlled trial includes a total of 64 children with OSA (32 children will be recruited from Study Group 1 and Study Group 2, respectively).

NCT00794040,A Controlled Trial of Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors Added to Stimulant Medication in Youth With Severe Mood Dysregulation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00794040,COMPLETED,"Severe mood dysregulation (SMD) is a very common syndrome in children. Its symptoms include very severe irritability, including persistent anger and frequent outbursts, as well as distractibility, hyperactivity, and other symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Many children with SMD receive the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD) in the community, although they do not have clear manic episodes (with symptoms such as extreme happiness and decreased need for sleep). Because SMD has not been studied in depth, we do not know which medications are most helpful to those with SMD. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the stimulant medication methylphenidate (MPH, more commonly known as Ritalin ) when combined (or not combined) with the antidepressant citalopram (Celexa ) in treating symptoms of SMD in children and adolescents. This study will provide information about how to treat SMD in youth.

This study will include approximately 80 patients between 7 and 17 years of age with SMD. The patient s symptoms must have started before age 12.

The study will consist of four phases carried out over 4 to 5 months. During Phase 1, the patient will undergo blood and urine tests, and will gradually taper off his or her medication. The duration of this phase depends on the patient s medication before starting the study. In Phase 2, the patient remains off all medication for 1 week. In Phase 3, the patient will be treated with MPH for 2 weeks, and then will be randomly assigned to receive either MPH plus citalopram or MPH plus a placebo for a further 8 weeks. In Phase 4, the researchers will evaluate the effectiveness of the medications taken, and begin an open treatment phase using medications that they deem appropriate for that patient (this may include MPH with citalopram and/or other medication combinations).

The investigators will tailor three empirically-supported team development interventions, Team Charters, Team Communication Training (Student Handoff Protocols), and Team Performance Monitoring, and integrate them into a team-enhanced CLS implementation protocol (CLS-T). Team Charters are a written document developed collaboratively by the team at the outset of their work together outlining expectations, goals, roles and responsibilities, and relevant policies and procedures for team collaborative operations. Research shows that Team Charters strengthen affective emergent states, such as trust and cohesion among team members, as well as cognitive emergent states, such as shared mental models. They also strengthen team processes, such as goal specification, communication, and coordination to optimize team effectiveness. Handoff protocols are widely used interventions for ensuring continuity in patient care and minimizing errors in medical settings. They have also been found to improve affective (e.g., trust, cohesion) and cognitive (e.g., shared mental models, situation awareness) emergent states among team members, enhancing team communication and coordination. Finally, Team Performance Monitoring provides feedback to teams that can motivate performance, provide opportunities for adaptation in the event of challenges, and prompt communication among team members. The investigators will conduct a Hybrid Type III cluster randomized trial in 24 schools in two large urban school districts, to evaluate whether CLS-T implementation results in improved implementation outcomes and child outcomes in comparison to standard CLS implementation.",NO,Team-effectiveness Research|School-based Interventions|Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder|Implementation Science,BEHAVIORAL: Team-Enhanced Collaborative Life Skills Program|BEHAVIORAL: Standard Collaborative Life Skills Program,"University of California, San Diego","National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)|University of California, San Francisco|San Diego State University",INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2024-01-01

NCT05600881,Towards an Understanding of the Mechanism of Action of Methylphenidate in ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05600881,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Approximately 1-in-20 children worldwide have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a condition associated with disabling inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. These problems can manifest as poor inhibitory control (e.g., difficulty holding back impulsive actions) and atypical reward processing (e.g., failing to learn from adverse outcomes). Poorly treated ADHD is associated with negative academic and socioeconomic consequences.

This project aims to ultimately improve clinical management of children with ADHD. Methylphenidate, a stimulant medication, is used as the first-option pharmacological treatment for ADHD and often successfully reduces problem behaviour. Although Methylphenidate can be extremely effective, it does not work for every child. There is currently no 'objective' way (e.g., blood test or brain scan) to measure if a child is genuinely responding to Methylphenidate. Instead, clinicians must rely on reports from parents and teachers, an approach that is problematic and that often leads to delays in optimising ADHD treatment. The absence of a biological test to quantify Methylphenidate response is primarily because we do not understand exactly how Methylphenidate changes behaviours to produce the known beneficial effects. This lack of knowledge is despite the very common use of this medication.

This project will investigate the specific brain processes that are affected by Methylphenidate by recording brain activity and behaviour in children with ADHD (who have already been prescribed Methylphenidate as part of their clinical care) when they are on and off this medication. Brain activity will be recorded using two separate approaches, which are both non-invasive and routinely used in Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience: electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Brain activity data will be collected while children with ADHD are performing two computer-game like tasks. One task measures the child's ability to hold back impulsive actions (inhibition) and the other assesses how they learn from positive and negative outcomes (reward processing). The data from the two tasks, the EEG recording and the fMRI scan will be analysed using advanced computer-modelling approaches to determine exactly how Methylphenidate changes behaviour.

This project is important because if we can understand the brain mechanisms affected by Methylphenidate, we can ultimately develop a computerised measure that will allow clinicians to predict whether a child is going to respond to this treatment or not. Such a measure would allow clinicians to treat ADHD more effectively and would result in children with ADHD experiencing faster relief from symptoms.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,DRUG: Methylphenidate,"University of Dublin, Trinity College","St. James's Hospital, Ireland",OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2023-06

NCT03628781,Improving ADHD Behavioral Care,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03628781,COMPLETED,"Though the most effective treatment for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) consists of combined medication and behavioral strategies, the vast majority of children with ADHD are treated with medication only. One reason for the low rates of behavioral treatment is that primary care pediatricians, not mental health professionals, are responsible for treating the vast majority of children with ADHD. The investigators have developed, tested, and are beginning to disseminate web-based software (mehealth for ADHD) that has been shown in randomized clinical trials to improve the quality of ADHD medication care delivered by pediatricians. The goal of the proposed study is to develop and test the integration of behavioral tools into the evidence-based myadhdportal.com software in order to improve access to behavioral treatment strategies, and ultimately improve outcomes for children with ADHD. The automated algorithms and decision rules the investigators have developed for creating and monitoring the behavioral tools ensure that behavioral treatments like daily report cards and token economies are delivered in a manner that is consistent with the evidence-base. The investigators are conducting a cluster randomized controlled trial in community pediatric settings to test whether integration of the behavioral tools into the myADHDportal.com software (1) increases rates of behavioral treatment; (2) facilitates better integrity of behavioral interventions when implemented; (3) improves functional impairment in children with ADHD; and (4) generates higher satisfaction with ADHD care. By continuing to expand the functionality of the myADHDportal.com software, the investigators are increasing patients' access to evidence-based care. This is especially critical for rural and underserved communities who have no or limited access to evidence-based mental health services. Moreover, by putting these behavioral tools in the hands of parents, teachers, and pediatricians, the investigators are making it more likely that children will receive a high quality of care that includes both medication management and behavioral strategies, thereby improving the overall treatment outcomes of children with ADHD.",YES,ADHD,OTHER: Behavioral tools integrated within mehealth for ADHD software|OTHER: mehealth for ADHD,"Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati",Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ),INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2018-09-17

NCT05930912,Psychiatric Orders in Psychoanalytic Treatment of ASD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05930912,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is often accompanied by a variety of other symptoms, such as bipolar disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), etc. The behavioral and social complications often marginalize the population, impact on life satisfaction, undermined societal values that impact on economic and financial fairness, and so forth. Furthermore, persons with ASD are neurodiverse from standardized pharmacological and clinical cares, and are interpreted disadvantaged in the context of neurotypical treatments.

The research protocol aims to differentiate the neuropharmacological implications of ASD from its behavioral and social implications. Such a differentiation is beneficial to the quality of care for neurodiverse population, both in terms of precision treatment in medical settings, and in terms of psychotherapeutic treatment efficacy in the interpretation of behavioral and social traits.

The study protocol continues from the adverse event of the participant in NCT05711810 trial, after the positive immunological results in the NCT05839236 trial. The intervention medicine continues from Sertraline adjusted on the choice of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) in the previous two trials for complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) of the participant, and its combined used with Duloxetine in the choice of Selective Norephedrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) for norephedrine regulations.

The hypothesized target is on the discrete psychiatric intervention centered approach to ASD treatment care. In the PRC where the study is being carried out, amphetamine class medicines are strictly prohibited and defined as illegal substances, regardless of their only proven effect for ASD patient care.

In order to do this, children ages 7-11 whose primary difficulty is with attention problems and who have never been on behavioral or psychiatric medications are being recruited. Once enrolled, children will try one week each of 3 different doses of methylphenidate, the most commonly prescribed Attention Deficit, Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) medication, as well as placebo.

Gait disorders could be also partly related to noradrenergic system impairment, pharmacological modulation of both dopamine and noradrenaline pathways could potentially improve the symptomatology. The investigators have demonstrated using an open label study on 17 advanced PD patients that chronic, high doses of methylphenidate (MPD) improved gait, freezing of gait, motor symptoms and attention in the absence of L-Dopa and increased the intensity of response of these symptoms to L-Dopa (Devos et al., 2007). The investigators aimed to confirm their results using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentric trial.

NCT00341029,Genetic Measurements in Blood Cells of Children Taking Adderall or Methylphenidate,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00341029,COMPLETED,"This study, conducted at Duke University in Durham, NC, will determine whether the drugs Adderall and methylphenidate affect the genetic material of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). One small study has shown that taking methylphenidate for ADHD may result in higher levels of certain types of changes to the genetic material contained in white blood cells. The changes seen are not directly linked to increased risk of disease, but indicate a possibility that other kinds of damage that may be linked to increased disease may result from taking methylphenidate. The study will also examine whether these types of changes might occur in children treated with Adderall .

Children between the ages of 6 and 12 with symptoms of ADHD may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, psychiatric examination, IQ test, physical examination, and electrocardiogram. Parents and teachers complete questionnaires to rate the severity of the child's ADHD. Qualified children who are diagnosed with ADHD and who are appropriate candidates for treatment with either Adderall or methylphenidate-based drugs (e.g., Concerta, Metadate, Focalin, Ritalin or Ritalin LA) may be selected for this study.

At a baseline visit (Visit 0), parents complete questionnaires that rate the severity of their child's ADHD. The children have their vital signs checked (pulse, blood pressure, breathing rate, height, weight and temperature) and have a blood sample drawn. The children are then randomly assigned to treatment with either Adderall or a methylphenidate product. After the baseline visit, participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

Dose Optimization Visits (visits 1-4)

In the first 4 weeks of the study, the dose of methylphenidate or Adderall is adjusted weekly until doctors determine the dose strength that works best for the individual child. In addition, the following procedures are done at each visit:

* Child's vital signs are checked.
* Parents complete a questionnaire about the severity of the child's ADHD.
* Parent and child describe the impact of symptoms on the child's functioning.
* Parents complete forms about common side effects of the study drug.

Follow-up Visits (visits 5-6)

Children return to the clinic once a month to assess their health and further adjust their medication dose, if needed. The visits are similar to those during the dose optimization period, with the following additional procedures at visit 6:

* A blood sample is obtained to measure whether the medication has affected the child's genetic material.
* A physical examination is done to check child's health.
* Information is provided parents to assist in planning for child's treatment after the study.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|ADHD,,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS),,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2005-12-07

NCT05832489,EEG-MRI Imaging of Methylphenidate Effects in Adult ADHD and Attentional Symptoms in Mood Disorders,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05832489,RECRUITING,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults is a common psychiatric disorder, with important consequences in terms of quality of life, mental health (associated disorders and poorer response to treatment), family life, risk of accidents; with a consequent cost for society.

Adult ADHD is frequently associated with psychiatric co-morbidities, and notably associated with mood disorders (major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder) in about 50% of cases.

The diagnosis of ADHD in adults is made in patients with an attentional complaint (pure ADHD or ADHD-P), but also very often in the management of a comorbid mood disorder (ADHD associated with mood disorder, or ADHD-MD). In this case, the ADHD had no impact during childhood and adolescence.

Medication management is well established for ADHD-P, and medication is based on methylphenidate, which has a rapid and significant effect on attentional symptoms and impulsivity. However, in the case of ADHD-HD, there is little evidence of treatment efficacy and the mechanisms of action of methylphenidate at the brain level are poorly understood.

The aim of the study is to determine the neural mechanisms of the effect of methylphenidate, using functional MRI and EEG, in ADHD-P and ADHD-HD patients, and to compare them to healthy subjects. A single dose allows us to observe effects that are then persistent with repeated doses. The aim is to determine, by means of a biomarker, whether methylphenidate treatment responds to the same mechanisms in the different groups and would be relevant in ADHD-P as in ADHD-HD.

Main objective:

To determine whether methylphenidate impacts differently on brain circuits associated with cognitive functions in the two clinical populations studied (adult ADHD patients and patients with post mood disorder attentional deficit) and in comparison to controls.

Secondary objectives:

1. To determine the effect of methylphenidate on baseline brain flow in the two clinical populations and in controls (healthy subjects).
2. To determine whether methylphenidate has a different impact on cognitive performance in the two clinical populations studied and in comparison to controls (healthy subjects).
3. To confirm the effect of methylphenidate on the maintenance of cortical arousal.
4.

The cognition-enhancing effect of tPBM on sustained attention in adults with ADHD remains unstudied. The investigators will evaluate whether tPBM administration to adults with and without ADHD can improve their attention. Each participant will be screened for eighteen criteria based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV, text revised), using the validated instrument Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1). Blinded participants will be randomized into (I) Active-tPBM or (II) Sham-tPBM groups. After undergoing an 8-minute administration of Sham or 1064 nm tPBM to the lateral and medial right prefrontal cortex, each participant will complete a 14-minute, computer-based Conner's continuous performance task-3 (CPT-3). The investigators will examine whether adults with and without ADHD who receive Active-tPBM improve in measures of inattention, impulsivity, sustained attention, or vigilance compared to the Sham-tPBM group. Cognitive assessments of attention like the CPT-3 may evaluate the efficacy of tPBM to increase cortical metabolism in healthy adults and individuals with conditions like ADHD. The investigators anticipate their investigation will be a starting point for more sophisticated studies that focus on the implications of tPBM on cognition.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|Attention Difficulties|Attention Deficit|Cognitive Deficit|Wellness,DEVICE: Transcranial photobiomodulation|DEVICE: Sham transcranial photobiomodulation,University of Texas at Austin,,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",2022-02-09

NCT04766580,Attention and Pain in Children With and Without Attention Deficit and/or Hyperactivity Disorder,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04766580,RECRUITING,"In Quebec, there has been an important increase of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnosis since 2015. ADHD symptoms, related to behavioural and/or concentration difficulties, are very similar to other disorders symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, and have a significant impact on students' academic success and future life. Adults (parent, teacher, coach) expectations towards a child's abilities are consciously or unconsciously perceived by the child, influence his expectations of his own abilities, and thus his academic performance (Pygmalion effect). The child and his entourage's expectations are therefore a major factor to consider, especially in school-age children. According to ADHD studies, some brain areas involved in pain regulation and in attention cognitive abilities develop at a slower rate in children with ADHD than the other children.

Considering the deleterious consequences generated by the symptoms of this disorder, the research project aims to better understand the role of expectations in children with ADHD in a medical (pain) and school (attention abilities) context. It also aims to contribute to better understand the role of the brain on the expectations effect and ADHD. In this study, children expectations will be modulated while pain experiments and cognitive task will be realized by children with and without ADHD. Brain measures will also be assessed with advanced techniques.

Thus, we hope that the results will help improve intervention strategies in these contexts to ensure better support for children with ADHD, with a distant goal of contributing to the development of stronger tools for differential diagnostics.",NO,Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity|Placebo Effect|Nocebo Effect|Pain,BEHAVIORAL: Placebo and nocebo effect,Université de Sherbrooke,,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2021-02-17

Furthermore, studies show that these factors are related to neurophysiological characteristics found in electroencephalographic (EEG) or functional NIRS (fNIRS) examinations (e.g., Barry, Clarke, \& Johnstone, 2003; Barry, Johnstone, \& Clarke, 2003; Loo \& Barkley, 2005; Negoro et al., 2010). Neurofeedback trainings aim at improving these neurophysiological as well as cognitive-behavioral deficits (Gevensleben, Moll, Rothenberger, \& Heinrich, 2014), and are expected to improve academic performance in children with ADHD accordingly. Training in a VR classroom, from the investigators' perspective, facilitates generalization of self-regulation competences to real-life academic situations and at the same time increases the effort invested into the training compared to a training in 2D settings. Consequently, training in a VR classroom is hypothesized to lead to greater improvement in academic performance, EF and a greater decrease of ADHD symptoms than a training in a 2D setting. Moreover, the investigators hypothesize that these effects are more pronounced in children who receive a NIRS-based neurofeedback training compared to children receiving a biofeedback training based on an electromyogram (EMG).",NO,Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder of Childhood or Adolescence Nos,BEHAVIORAL: EMG-based biofeedback training|BEHAVIORAL: NIRS-based neurofeedback training,University Hospital Tuebingen,,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2015-09

CBIT is a first-line behavioral treatment for individuals with tic disorders. However, the benefit of CBIT is mitigated in those with co-occurring ADHD, as ADHD is negatively associated with effect size in behavioral treatments for tics. Additionally, while tic disorders are associated with reduced quality of life measures, CBIT is 'tic-specific.' Despite improving tics, measures do not show associated improved quality of life. Currently, there are no standardized behavioral treatments for tics that account for ADHD symptoms and/or addresses the impact that tics and ADHD symptoms have on quality of life.

The first aim is to develop a treatment protocol that combines elements from CBIT, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for ADHD and factors targeting psychosocial impairment.

The second aim is to determine the treatment feasibility and acceptability (e.g. retention, reasons for treatment refusal and dropout, and motivation) of this modified CBIT treatment. The investigators will evaluate and assess the randomization process, the treatment modules, and the expectations and satisfaction of the participants and their parents.

The final aim is to use a pilot randomized control trial (RCT) design to evaluate improvement using measures including tic, ADHD and quality of life scales as rated by a blinded clinician.

NCT01363544,Train Your Brain and Exercise Your Heart? Advancing the Treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01363544,COMPLETED,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder that has a severe impact on a child's life and society. The core symptoms are attention problems, hyperactivity and impulsivity. These symptoms are related to disruptions in neurocognitive functions (such as inhibition: the ability to stop behavior) and disruptions in cortical regulation (such as 'cortical underarousal' as measured with the electroencephalogram). To date, the only evidence-based treatment is pharmacological. Medication is not effective in 20-30% of the children with ADHD and it can have side effects. The lack of alternatives for medication is a severe problem for these children and society.

Neurofeedback is becoming increasingly popular for treating ADHD. Neurofeedback is a training in which a person learns to alter its cortical regulation. Neurofeedback has been classified as 'probably effective' but its treatment effects need further empirical evidence. Non specific training effects, such as individual attention, may also contribute to treatment success. In this research project the investigators compare the efficacy of neurofeedback with exercise, a second non-pharmacological treatment, that may be comparable with neurofeedback in terms of non-specific effects. Exercise is also a promising treatment because of its positive effects on behavior, neurocognition in several patient groups. For these reasons, exercise deserves systematic research in ADHD. Furthermore, the investigators compare the efficacy of these two treatments with an optimal pharmacological treatment with methylphenidate (MPH). The main question is if neurofeedback and exercise are comparable in efficacy with MPH for treating ADHD. The primary outcome measure is behaviour (symptoms of ADHD). Secondary outcome measures include neurocognition and cortical regulation. This research project will give answer to the question if neurofeedback and exercise are as effective as MPH. Furthermore, it will give insight in how these interventions will give rise to improvements in behavior.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),OTHER: Neurofeedback|BEHAVIORAL: Exercise|DRUG: methylphenidate,R. van Mourik,ZonMw: The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development|Yulius,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2010-06

The proposed intervention is based on models of habituation, which is a term that means reduced physiological and emotional response to a stimulus (e.g. moving object, or loud noise, etc.) as it is seen repeatedly. The investigators use virtual reality technology to show study participants distracting stimuli repeatedly in a virtual classroom setting, and their hypothesis states that participants will improve attention in the face of distraction by training with this technology intervention.

While some argue that agents that block dopaminergic receptors may have a deleterious cognitive effect, others stress their moderating effects, which possibly improve function in all domains, including cognitive functions. Only a few studies have examined this topic, with inconclusive results.

Aim of study: To measure the effect of risperidone treatment on various cognitive functions in a population of ADHD diagnosed children and adolescents with normal IQ.

Design: The study is an observational prospective open label clinical controlled trial. The investigators will compare the performance in a battery of cognitive tasks using the Penn Web-Based Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (WebCNP) and the IGT, in children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD, with and without risperidone.

Study population: Children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD, 8-17 years old, may be eligible for this study. We will recruit subjects who their psychiatrist is considering rispieridone treatment, those who are already treated with risperidone and subjects with only stimulants treatment. All pharmacological treatment is supervised and prescribed to subjects by their personal psychiatrist unrelated to the study.

NCT03620344,ADHD/Me Bibliotherapy Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03620344,TERMINATED,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. It affects approximately 8% of school aged children and is characterized by persistent symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity. Typical ADHD assessments primarily involve interviewing the parents and gathering rating scales from parents and teachers. Feedback regarding diagnosis, clinical conceptualization, and treatment recommendations is usually provided by the clinical staff to the child's parents in the absence of the child. Hence, the ADHD diagnosis and repercussions of that diagnosis are often left unexplained to the child. Research has shown that bibliotherapy is an effective educational tool that can be used to help parents discuss ADHD diagnosis and treatment with their child. The aim of this study is to conduct a randomized trial in which tools for parents who are getting their elementary-aged (7 to 10-year-old) children evaluated for ADHD are explored. The evaluations (N=60) will be conducted at the Center for ADHD at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) in Cincinnati, OH. Half of the families (n=30) will be randomly assigned to the intervention group, where they will be provided with the child-focused ""ADH-Me!"" book during the feedback session, and the remaining half will not receive it.

NCT02205268,Near Infrared Spectroscopy Neurofeedback Training for ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02205268,UNKNOWN,"Background Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most frequently diagnosed behavioural disorders in childhood that requires treatment(3-5% of children). It is an important health problem because it impairs social, educational and occupational performance, and increases the risk of other psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression and substance misuse. There is no cure for ADHD and standard stimulant medication treatment is at best symptomatic. Moreover, stimulants have side effects and parents are often concerned over the long-term effects. A number of non-drug treatments have been developed but these do not target the brain directly. Neurofeedback Training (NTx) is a new, non-drug treatment that targets the brain directly and that can potentially enhance the control of attention in ADHD. NTx could be a valuable alternative and/or adjunct to standard care.

Aims Although NTx has gained popularity in Europe and the US, more rigorous studies are required to support its implementation in the NHS. We therefore propose a pilot study to establish tolerabilty and safety, and to develop treatment protocols and collect data to design a follow-on controlled NTx trial in ADHD.

Methods We plan an open label, single arm, treatment trial of near infrared spectroscopy neurofeedback training of frontal lobe activation in school-aged children with ADHD. 48 participants will be recruited over 1 year and will be offered 20 NTx sessions over 10 weeks. Participants will be recruited from Mental Health Services.

The assignment will be carried out using a hand held dynamometer which measures the power produced by the participants' upper extremity.

NCT02150668,Efficacy of an Organizational Skills Intervention for Middle School Students With ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02150668,COMPLETED,"Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed childhood disorders, with prevalence rates estimated at 8%. Several of the primary symptoms of ADHD relate to problems with temporal and materials organization (i.e. has difficulty organizing tasks and activities, loses things, is forgetful, and fails to finish school-work). In the school setting, problems with organization manifest as forgetting to complete or losing homework assignments, difficulties planning for the completion of long-term projects and studying for tests, and problems keeping class materials organized. These organizational difficulties become particularly problematic in middle school and are associated with low school grades and high parent and teacher ratings of academic impairment. In fact, organization of homework materials is one of the strongest predictors of academic performance in students with ADHD, above and beyond the impact of intelligence, school services, and ADHD medication use, and mediates the relationship between symptoms of ADHD and school grades.

Given the relationship between temporal and materials organization and poor school performance, it is clear there is a need for interventions to address these difficulties. The PI sought to address this need by completing an IES Goal 2 study to develop a school-based intervention targeting organizational skills that was feasible for school mental health (SMH) providers to implement. The Homework, Organization and Planning Skills (HOPS) intervention was developed and refined based upon input from 20 school mental health (SMH) providers, students with ADHD and their families. SMH providers implemented the HOPS intervention, rated the intervention as highly user-friendly and feasible to implement, and demonstrated excellent fidelity to intervention procedures. Students who received the HOPS intervention made significant improvements in homework problems and organizational skills compared to a waitlist control. The feasibility and fidelity data demonstrate that the intervention has potential for widespread dissemination. Preliminary outcome data suggest that the intervention may significantly improve the academic performance of students with ADHD. However, the small sample size (N=23 HOPS \& N=24 control) precludes firm conclusions about efficacy and moderators and mediators of intervention response. Accordingly, the primary goal of this Goal 3 study is to evaluate the efficacy of the HOPS intervention, which focuses teaching students' organization and time-management skills, as compared to an intervention targeting on-task behaviors during homework completion and efficiency of work completion, the Homework Support Intervention (HSI), and to assess moderators and mediators of intervention response.

Middle school students with ADHD (N=260) will be randomly assigned to receive the HOPS intervention or the HSI intervention. Students in both groups will receive the same amount of intervention in terms of duration and frequency of intervention sessions. Six cohorts of students will be recruited for the project. Each cohort will consist of 22 students at each of two schools (44 per cohort) who will be randomly assigned to each of the two conditions. Objective measures of skills implementation, parent and teacher ratings of organization, homework problems, and academic impairment, and school grades will be examined pre and post intervention as well as at 8-week and 6-month follow-ups. Treatment fidelity and integrity will be closely monitored. Moderator and mediator analyses will be used to answer important questions about the types of students most likely to benefit from organizational skills intervention and the key mechanisms of change that lead to improved academic performance. This study has significant potential to improve the academic performance of students with ADHD because the intervention was designed with SMH provider input and has clear potential for widespread dissemination upon proof of efficacy.",NO,Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),"BEHAVIORAL: Homework, Organization, and Planning Skills (HOPS) Intervention|BEHAVIORAL: Homework Support Intervention (HSI)",Virginia Commonwealth University,U.S. Department of Education,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2013-09

NCT01108029,Study of Memantine for Gait Disorders And Attention Deficit In Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01108029,COMPLETED,"Along with cognitive and psychobehavioural disorders, gait disorders represent a major problem in the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). PD can be considered to be a hyperglutamatergic disease because dopaminergic depletion induces hyperactivity of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the internal pallidum (GPi), with glutamatergic hyperactivity of the STN's efferent pathway, i.e., the subthalamopallidal, subthalamonigral and subthalamo-entopeduncular pathways (projecting to the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN)). Excess glutamate in the PPN has also been observed in the 6-OHDA rat model of PD. Reduction of this glutamatergic hyperactivity within the PPN via the systemic or intra-peduncular administration of glutamate antagonists improves akinesia in drug-induced murine and primate models of PD, via the NMDA and AMPA receptors. High doses of memantine (10 mg/kg) improve locomotion in reserpine- and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine-treated rats. In humans, the PPN may play a key role in gait, posture control, axial rigidity and attention. It is also involved in the gating of sensory information involved in the startle reflex, which can be studied via prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the blink reflex. At present, two uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists are approved for use in humans: amantadine and memantine. Reviews of the recent literature on these drugs have identified no published studies specifically on severe gait and attention disorders in PD. Memantine is a partial blocker of open NMDA channels. The value of memantine relates to the fact that it decreases excessive glutamatergic transmission by lowering the synaptic noise due to excessive activation of NMDA receptors. In this double-blind study, the investigators shall seek to demonstrate the presence or absence of an effect of memantine on gait and attention disorders. In order to study the interaction between glutamatergic hyperactivity and the dopaminergic system, the investigators shall study the phenomena both in the absence of L-dopa and following acute administration of the latter.

NCT05496140,Remote School-Home Program to Improve Youth Attention and Behavior in Mexican Students,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05496140,COMPLETED,"Neurodevelopmental disorders of inattention and disruptive behavior, such as Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), are among the most common youth mental health conditions across cultures. An efficacious and feasible solution to improving affected youth's ADHD/ODD is training existing school clinicians to deliver evidence-based intervention with fidelity. Despite initial promising results of training school clinicians to treat ADHD/ODD in settings suffering from high unmet need, such as Mexico, scalability is limited by a lack of researchers with capacity to train, monitor, and evaluate school clinicians in such efforts on a large scale. Thus, there is a need to develop more feasible interventions and training programs for school clinicians, as well as create a system with capacity for scalable training and evaluation, to combat the widespread impact ofADHD/ODD worldwide. Converting interventions and school clinician professional development programs for fully-remote delivery allows for more flexibility, accessibility, affordability, scalability, and promise for ongoing consultation than in-person options. Supporting scalable training for school clinicians could address a significant public health concern in Mexico, as only 14% of Mexican youth with mental health disorders receive treatment and less than half of those treated receive more than minimally adequate care. The study team is uniquely suited for this effort, given that they developed the only known school-home ADHD/ODD evidence-based intervention in Latin America-and-have developed a web-based training for U.S. school clinicians with promising preliminary results. The study team's prior studies and high levels of unmet need make Mexico an ideal location for this proposal; however, lessons learned could be used to expand scalable school clinician training for evidence-based intervention in other settings and/or for other disorders. Thus, this study focuses on comparing the fully-remote CLS-R-FUERTE program vs. care-as-usual in an 8-school clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT). The team predicts: 1) school clinicians trained in the remote program will be satisfied and show improved skills, 2) parents, youth, and teachers treated by school clinicians in the remote program will engage/adhere, and 3) youth in the remote program will show more ADHD/ODD improvements compared to care-as-usual",NO,ADHD|Oppositional Defiant Disorder,BEHAVIORAL: CLS-R-FUERTE,"University of California, San Francisco",National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2022-09-01

This would be a novel study as there is no known safety or efficacy data for amphetamine based medications in this population. In addition, although health related quality of life and executive function are known to improve with the treatment of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in the ADHD population (Banaschewski 2013; Findling 2009; Turgay 2010), it has not been shown in the co-morbid ADHD and ASD population. ADHD is the most common pediatric neurobiological condition affecting approximately five percent of the pediatric population (Feldman 2009). ASD is being increasingly recognized as affecting a substantial amount of the pediatric population, with recent prevalence data showing 1 in 68 affected (Baio, 2014). Prior to the introduction of DSM-5 (APA, 2013), exclusion criteria precluded the diagnosis of ADHD when ASD was present. Studies have shown that 41%-71% of children with ASD also meet criteria for ADHD (Goldstein 2004, Sturm 2004,Yoshida 2004, Gadow 2006). This means that up to 1% of the population may have co-morbid ADHD and ASD. With the official recognition of this comorbidity, treatment of comorbid ADHD when ASD is also present has been increasingly recognized as an important strategy in improving executive functioning and quality of life in those affected. Studies have indicated that some of the medications commonly used to treat ADHD, are effective and safe when used in comorbid ADHD and ASD.

The rationale for the proposed study is to examine the efficacy of stimulants for college students with ADHD and help prevent stimulant misuse among college students without ADHD. The working hypothesis is that stimulants, compared to baseline and placebo conditions, will improve executive functioning for college students with ADHD but not for college students without ADHD.

In recent years, some researchers have become interested in analyzing neuroendocrine substrate levels in ADHD, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), cortisol and testosterone. Previous work in ADHD has established a strong heritable component to the phenotype. The STS gene, SULT2A1 gene and TH gene are associated with the function of DHEA/DHEA-S, and the NR3C1 gene is associated with the regulation of cortisol. Therefore, the relationship between these genes and the etiology of ADHD warrants investigation. Moreover, compared to the phenotype, the endophenotypes of ADHD may be more capable of detecting the underlying neurobiological and hereditary mechanisms. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the relationships between neuroendocrine substrates (DHEA, DHEA-S, cortisol and testosterone), candidate genes (STS gene, SULT2A1 gene, TH gene and NR3C1 gene) and the phenotype and endophenotypes (disease subtypes, neurocognitive function and response to treatment) of ADHD.

To complete this work, we will recruit 300 patients with ADHD (probands) and 600 biological parents of the probands. DNA will be extracted from buccal cells by cheek swab. At baseline, saliva samples of ADHD patients will be collected between 7:00 and 8:00 am using the passive drool method, to analyze the levels of neuroendocrine substrates. The patients will undergo assessment for their clinical symptoms and neurocognitive function. Methylphenidate will then be administered to the patients and the usual practice followed. At week 4 and week 52, procedures similar to those performed at baseline will be repeated.

The results of this study may further elucidate the complexity of the pathophysiology of ADHD. We may determine whether the neuroendocrine system, which contains levels of neuroendocrine substrates and associated genes, plays a crucial role in the phenotype and endophenotypes of ADHD. The information may serve as an important reference for the direction of future study and clinical treatment for patients with ADHD.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,DRUG: Methylphenidate,Chang Gung Memorial Hospital,,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2013-08

NCT02035176,Novel Measure of Social Deficits in Children,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02035176,COMPLETED,"Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) feature impairments in social interaction and communication. Drug and behavioral treatments for ASD are undergoing rapid development, yet our diagnostic tools are not suitable for efficacy assessment. The Autism-Diagnosis Observational Schedule (ADOS) is a clinical interview with the child and the gold standard for diagnosis. However, this test is subjective, course grained and costly, precluding repeated tests of the same child to assess treatment efficacy and large-scale control assessments of typically developing (TD) children. For these reasons, the ADOS can impede imaging and genetic research.

In light of these concerns, the Oregon Animation Test for Social Reciprocity (OATS) will be developed to evaluate distinct autistic behavioral phenotypes, including joint attention, empathy, imitation, and lack of narrative coherence. The main idea of OATS is that animated characters and social scenarios are presented on a computer screen while the responses of the child are recorded by video camera, microphone, and eye-tracking equipment. Animations are used to test each behavioral phenotype of autism. The long-term vision for OATS is to evaluate behavioral and physiological responses of autistic children, including heart rate variability, pupil dilation, and EEG. Our first objective is to use existing animations to build an OATS ""Prototype"" that discriminates autistic from normal children (Aim 1). From these results, and use of a defined library of still frame posed images, we will design our own animation platform to assess differences between autistic and normal children (Aim 2).",NO,Autism Spectrum Disorders|ADHD,,Oregon Health and Science University,,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2014-02

NCT06080373,Formulation-based CBT for Adult Inmates With ADHD: A Randomized Controlled Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06080373,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Background Recent literature suggests that ADHD is a risk factor for the development of antisocial behavior that is more severe and persistent than in community and other psychiatric populations. The combination of stimulant medication and psychotherapy (particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy, CBT) is considered an evidence-based intervention for adults with ADHD. In contrast, few studies have evaluated the efficacy of medication in adult prisoners with ADHD, and the literature on the efficacy of psychotherapy is virtually nonexistent. Therefore, this article presents the protocol of a trial that will assess the efficacy of a formulation-based CBT program for inmates with ADHD.

Methods The study has a multicenter randomized controlled trial design. After screening and recruitment, participants will be randomly assigned to the CBT intervention, a general offender treatment program, or a waitlist. Pre- and post-treatment self-report and clinician-report assessments, as well as 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments will be conducted. These will include both clinical (e.g., ADHD symptoms, depression and anxiety symptoms, self-esteem, alcohol/drug abuse, treatment adherence, quality of life) and criminological (e.g., recidivism and risk of recidivism) measures. Linear mixed models will be used to assess differences between groups.

Discussion This study may be the first to evaluate the efficacy of a psychotherapy intervention in adult inmates with ADHD. It is expected that addressing the specific needs of ADHD would not only result in the previously reported clinical improvements (e.g., reduction in ADHD and comorbidity symptoms), but also reduce the risk and rate of recidivism compared to the general intervention or no intervention.

Although HAART has resulted in fewer HIV-infected children getting sick and even fewer dying from AIDS, many children on this treatment regimen develop significant brain or nervous system problems, such as learning difficulties, attention problems, hyperactivity, and depression.

People who acquired HIV disease in the first decade of life and who have evidence of central nervous system (CNS) disease (e.g., encephalopathy, CNS compromise, ADHD, bipolar disease, major depression or psychosis) may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, neuropsychological testing and a CT scan of the head, if one has not been done within 12 months of entering the study.

Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

* MRI and MRS scan of the head: These tests use a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of the brain and detect changes in certain brain chemicals that may be affected by HIV infection. Both procedures are done at the same time. The patient lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a narrow cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. The procedure lasts about 50 to 60 minutes, during which time the patient can communicate with the staff.
* Neuropsychological testing: Patients' thinking and behavior are evaluated with tests to measure their memory, attention, language, problem-solving, academic, and motor skills and questionnaires to assess behavioral and emotional functioning, quality of life, and adherence to HIV medication. Parents are also asked to complete questionnaires assessing their child's behavioral and emotional functioning, quality of life, important life events, and adherence to HIV medication.
* Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is collected for analysis. For this procedure, a local anesthetic is given and a needle is inserted in the space between the bones in the lower back where the CSF circulates below the spinal cord. Some fluid is collected through the needle. Blood tests and a physical examination are done before the procedure to make sure it can be done as safely as possible. Patients may also be sedated to prevent any discomfort.
* Follow-up: The blood tests, MRI and MRS scans and spinal tap are repeated 1 and 2 years after the initial evaluation.

Tests such as the Conners' Rating Scale require subjective responses from parents and teachers, making coordination difficult. The computerized Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT) provides objective data in regards to inattention and impulsive patterns of response. However, it does not provide data regarding accessory movements such as restlessness, hyperactivity, and other inappropriate movements. If the subject taking the exam has a reading disorder, it will impair his or her ability to respond accurately and it will increase response time. The T.O.V.A. is another computer based test used as a diagnostic aid for ADHD, which uses a microswitch to record responses. It does utilize auditory and visual stimuli, which removes the reading level limitation. However, it is unable to measure to measure accessory movements that may be contributing to reaction time and errors of omission and commission.

NCT05301673,ADHD Remote Technology Study of Cardiometabolic Risk Factors and Medication Adherence,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05301673,RECRUITING,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder, with a prevalence among adults of 2.5%. The disorder is diagnosed based on impairing levels of inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive behaviours. Most adults with ADHD present with additional mental health problems. Adults with ADHD have an increased risk to develop so-called cardiometabolic illnesses, such as type-2 diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure). However, detailed knowledge about the screening, diagnosis and management of adults with ADHD and co-occurring cardiometabolic illnesses is lacking. The purpose of ART-CARMA is to (1) obtain real-world data from adults with ADHD daily life on the extent to which ADHD medication treatment and physical activity, individually and jointly, may influence cardiometabolic risks in adults with ADHD, and (2) obtain real-world data of patterns of taking ADHD medication and reasons for not taking medication, over a remote monitoring period of 12 months.

ART-CARMA benefits from the ADHD Remote Technology ('ART') assessment and monitoring system for adults with ADHD (developed by Kuntsi, Dobson, et al.), and the RADAR-base mobile-health platform to which it is linked (developed by Dobson et al; http://www.radar-base.org). ART consists of both active (e.g., questionnaires) and passive (smartphone and a wearable device) monitoring. ART-CARMA will use remote measurement technology (RMT) in adults with ADHD to carry out unobtrusive, real-time data collection over a continuous period of 12 months. By recruiting 300 adults from adult ADHD clinic waiting lists (and a partner/family member/close friend for each of them) and monitoring them remotely, we will obtain objectively measured data relevant to cardiometabolic risk profiles from their daily lives. By targeting the period before starting any ADHD medication through to starting treatment and the subsequent period, up to 12 months in total, we obtain real-time data on multiple parameters, including side effects, that can inform the personalisation of treatment.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|Cardiovascular Diseases|Medication Adherence,,King's College London,"South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust|Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust|Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron Research Institute|Empatica, Inc.|Örebro University, Sweden|Concentris research management gmbh|Attention Deficit Disorder Information and Support Service|The European Association for the Study of Obesity|Cumbria, Northumberland Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust|Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust|South West London and St George's Mental Health NHS Trust|East London NHS Foundation Trust|Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust",OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2022-07-12

NCT04112082,Efficacy of Mobile Neurofeedback for Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04112082,UNKNOWN,"This study is an assessor-blind, parallel-group, controlled trial to evaluate the benefit of home-based training with a low-cost, mobile neurofeedback system (Myndlift) in adults with ADHD. Randomized controlled trials have shown significant benefit for neurofeedback, including persistent effects without the side effects of psychostimulants (i.e., diminished appetite, insomnia, anxiety, irritability). However, standard application requires clinic visits and significant expense, limiting training frequency and compromising potential efficacy. Additionally, extant evidence for efficacy comes almost exclusively from children and adolescents, with very few studies in adults. The present trial will measure the ability of home-based neurofeedback using a low-cost, user-friendly system to ameliorate symptomatology (e.g., enhancing attention, reducing impulsive behavior) in adults with ADHD. Participants will receive either neurofeedback or treatment as usual (TAU). Primary outcomes will be objective scores on a continuous performance task (CPT) and subjective report on a standardized adult ADHD symptoms questionnaire. Eligible participants recruited from an adult ADHD clinic will complete a baseline assessment (1.25 hours) including subjective questionnaires, computerized cognitive assessment, and resting-state EEG administered by a blinded assessor. The experimental group will train at home with a neurofeedback headset and tablet 4 times/week for ten weeks (session duration: 21-30 minutes). Neurofeedback will be provided via a conventional theta beta protocol in which participants train using gamified tasks, videos, or audio clips in a tablet-based app, and receive positive visual/auditory feedback when their brainwaves are in the desired range. The control group will follow the regular treatment plan set by the clinic (i.e., treatment as usual; TAU). Care may include pharmacological intervention, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a combination of both, or no intervention. Care will often include pharmacological intervention (e.g., methylphenidate), with the specifics (e.g., type of medication, dosage) determined by psychiatrist recommendation. After completing the ten-week intervention period, all participants will return to the clinic for a follow-up assessment identical to the baseline assessment.

NCT03368573,QbTest Utility for Optimising Treatment in ADHD (QUOTA),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03368573,COMPLETED,"Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a condition that affects 3-5% of young people under 18-years-old.

Young people with ADHD have difficulties with attention, impulsivity and hyperactivity that make it harder for them to learn, form relationships and prepare for adulthood. Clinical guidelines state that young people taking medication for ADHD should be closely monitored and have their medication reviewed regularly to ensure they receive the correct dose to improve their symptoms. However, many young people aren't monitored as closely as guidelines recommend. This can lead to lack of improvement or worsening of symptoms meaning that children may not experience the benefits of medication as quickly as they should. At the moment, assessing whether or not medication is working relies on the opinions of teachers and parents, collected through questionnaires. The difficulties of this are: differences of opinion between people, lack of information provided by them, and not returning the questionnaires. A test performed on a computer (QbTest) provides doctors with a report of the young person's symptoms and can therefore show whether medication is working. This may help doctors reach accurate decisions about medication dose more quickly, reducing the need for questionnaires. The study team met with families and young people with ADHD and medical experts and developed a procedure for using QbTest to measure medication effects. The study team will measure how well this procedure works in the real world by asking a group of young people to complete the test when they first start taking medication and at their follow-up appointments. The study team will ask doctors and families/young people for their opinions on the procedure.

NCT04443179,Brain Imaging in Babies Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04443179,RECRUITING,"The aims of the BIBS Study

The Brain Imaging in Babies study (BIBS) aims to improve understanding of how a baby's brain develops from before birth, up until 3-4 years of age. Working with children from a variety of backgrounds and communities, the investigators use a combination of state-of-the-art diagnostic tools such as MRI scans alongside traditional behavioural assessments to capture the earliest information on infant brain development.

The focus of the BIBS study

MRI scanning is a safe way of producing detailed images using strong magnetic fields and radio waves. It does not use X-ray. Along with learning more about brain development in general, the investigators also try to identify features that may in future help predict whether a child will or will not develop traits of conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Long-term, this may help target useful interventions early on, helping children who are most in need.

Since COVID-19 arrived in the United Kingdom (U.K.) in 2020, the investigators have been given ethical approval to include testing for this infection in the mothers and children participating in the study. This may provide an opportunity to better understand how mother and baby respond to infections.

NCT02420990,Integrated Treatment for Adolescents With ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02420990,COMPLETED,"Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) exists in 20-50% of the 3 million adolescents annually enrolled in outpatient mental health and substance use treatment. Adolescents with ADHD present deficits in attention, self-regulation, and social competence that significantly impede achievement of developmental and educational milestones. Currently there are only two evidence-based treatment options for this age group: academic training and stimulant medications. Both options remain vastly underutilized. Academic training is not available in most school settings and rarely implemented in clinical care. Similarly, ADHD medications are rarely utilized with adolescents in primary or specialty care for a host of reasons related to stigma, misinformation about effects and side effects, and adolescent autonomy issues. Moreover, the widespread fragmentation of pharmacological versus behavioral services prevents families from making informed treatment selections.

The primary objective of this randomized parametric trial is to compare the effectiveness of behavioral only versus integrated (behavioral plus medication decision-making) interventions for adolescents with ADHD in outpatient behavioral services. The behavioral intervention, Changing Academic Support in the Home for Adolescents with ADHD (CASH-AA), contains three components: ADHD psychoeducation, family-based motivational interventions, and academic training. The medication decision-making intervention, Medication Integration Protocol (MIP), contain three components: psychoeducation about ADHD medication, family decision-making, and medication management. The study will compare the effects of two legitimate treatment options for adolescents with ADHD on service utilization, behavioral symptoms, and quality of life. It will generate new evidence on patient-centered treatment selection that aligns with family-specific principles and treatment goals.

This parametric comparative trial will randomly assign 140 inner-city adolescents with ADHD to (1) CASH-AA Only or (2) CASH-AA + MIP. Treatment will occur in community behavioral health clinics. All participants will receive behavioral interventions (CASH-AA): family psychoeducation in ADHD symptoms, executive functioning, and developmental impacts; family-based motivation and ADHD accommodation interventions; and academic training focused on home environment support and organizational skills. Half of the participants will also receive medication decision-making interventions (MIP): ADHD medication psychoeducation, family decision-making interventions, and (for those who elect to start medication) coordinated medication management. Half of the sample will have comorbid substance use problems. Treatment will occur in three community clinics; therapists will be randomly assigned to study condition. Caregivers and adolescents will complete assessments at baseline, 3, 6, and 12-month follow-up. Multilevel modeling will compare the effectiveness of each condition on key patient and service use outcomes. Patient-centered analyses will explore differential treatment effects based on (a) Medication decision (yes/no); (b) Substance use comorbidity (yes/no); (c) Race/Ethnicity (Hispanic, African American).

Quantitative outcome analyses will test for service use effects, symptom reduction, and quality of life improvements that are primary reasons for seeking clinical services. Qualitative interviews will document family-specific rationale for decisions about medication, compliance with behavioral and medication interventions, and suggestions for improving services and service integration. Note that families assigned to CASH-AA Only will retain the option of pursuing ADHD medication through treatment-as-usual procedures at their respective clinic. Similarly, families assigned to CASH-AA + MIP will not be required to start ADHD medication. Instead, they will receive informed-choice interventions and can choose when and if to start medication; the study will assess the impact of these decisions on clinical outcomes.

If proven efficacious, the CASH-AA and MIP protocols could be rapidly disseminated individually or as an integrated protocol into routine behavioral healthcare settings. The protocols can also be readily combined with other behavioral treatments to form a multicomponent treatment package for adolescents with co-occurring behavior problems. In addition, the family-based, patient-centered CASH-AA and MIP protocols could be delivered in conjunction with other family-based treatments or with individual approaches that flexibly include caregivers in multiple treatment sessions. This makes CASH-AA and MIP highly efficient clinical resources for addressing ADHD-related problems in any outpatient setting that serves adolescents and their families.",YES,ADHD|Substance Use Disorders,BEHAVIORAL: Medication Integration Protocol (MIP)|BEHAVIORAL: Changing Academic Support in the Home for Adolescents with ADHD (CASH-AA),The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University,Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2015-03-01

NCT02086864,A Placebo Controlled Study of Homeopathic Treatment of Children and Youth With ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02086864,COMPLETED,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder that presents during childhood, with at least some symptoms causing impairment before the age of seven. It is characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention and/or hyperactive-impulsive behavior, with significant impairment occurring in at least two settings. It affects approximately 5.2 million children in the United States. Homeopathic treatment has been shown to be a promising intervention for ADHD, however the reasons for that effectiveness is unclear. Specifically, it is unclear whether improvement is due to the homeopathic medicine, the consultative process, or other non-specific effects.

This study has 3 primary objectives: 1. to determine if there are any specific effects of homeopathic medicines in the treatment of ADHD, 2. to determine if there any specific effects the homeopathic consultation alone in the treatment of ADHD, and 3. to determine if there is an overall effect of homeopathic treatment (homeopathic medicines plus consultation) in the treatment of ADHD.

This is a three arm study. Participants will be randomized to one of three arms:

Arm 1 (Verum group): a treatment arm where the participant will receive homeopathic consultation plus a homeopathic remedy Arm 2 (Placebo group): a treatment arm where the participant will receive homeopathic consultation plus a placebo remedy Arm 3 (Usual care group): participants will continue with usual care and will not receive homeopathic treatment as part of the study.

Participants enrolled in this study, regardless of which study Arm they are in, may continue with all conventional medications or any other aspect of their current standard of care they are taking as recommended by their usual physician (so long as they are on a stable dose of the conventional ADHD medication for at least 6 weeks prior to beginning the trial). They may also continue to attend regularly scheduled visits with their own health care practitioner(s).

Participants may also start, stop or change the dose of any therapy (including conventional medications) during the study and are asked to report the change to the study team. Thus, the placebo group participants are not different than other participants, except that they will have a homeopathic consultation and a placebo remedy. The use of placebo is specific to homeopathic treatment, to allow for double-blinding, which is recognized to reduce study bias.

Prior to enrolling in the study, those considering participation will undergo a full assessment by a psychiatrist with a specialty in child and youth mental health. This assessment confirms the diagnosis and screens for inclusion/exclusion study criteria. At the same time, the psychiatrist recommends evidence-based therapies to clients including conventional medication. The psychiatrist does not directly treat the client. If medication is recommended and the clients wish to pursue it with their regular physician, they would still be able to enroll in the study if they wanted to, after six weeks of reaching a stable dose.

This study will help our understanding of the treatment process and whether different elements of the intervention have greater or lesser effects.

NCT04408521,Effects of a Novel Neurofeedback Protocol on ADHD Subcomponents,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04408521,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Mounting evidence suggests that closed-loop brain-training, commonly known as neurofeedback (NFB), may represent a new therapeutic opportunity for patients with Attentional Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which manifests as difficulties with attention and inhibitory control. In this context, the investigators have focused on an attention-enhancing form of NFB based on the EEG alpha rhythm, known to influence sensory detection and attention. In light of recent evidence showing that both attention and impulsivity can be modified with a single-session of alpha-NFB, the objective is to determine whether these effects stabilize in the long-term, after multiple, daily sessions of training at home.

A short- (single-session) and a long-term (multi-session) experimental design will be used to collect EEG, behavioral, and clinical data pre-to-post NFB. The single-blind study will recruit 48 adult ADHD participants randomly assigned to either NEUROFEEDBACK or CONTROL groups. Each participant will undergo individual at home sessions of 45-minute video-replay of popular television (TV) series while recording their 1-channel EEG (30 sessions, 5 sessions/week, 6 weeks total). In the NEUROFEEDBACK group, self-regulation of alpha rhythm will be reflected in the dynamically varying opacity of the video-replay window, i.e. the window would turn lighter/darker and reveal/obscure video content during episodes of low/high alpha amplitude, respectively. In the CONTROL group, the recording will be passive without real-time EEG neurofeedback (i.e. constant brightness and volume). Before and after at home training, each participant will have two visits in the lab: (1) complete clinical and neuropsychological evaluation and (2) EEG session including resting state and task-related EEG before and after a short NFB intervention (30 minutes). For the CONTROL group participants, the latter will be replaced by a sham intervention utilizing non-contingent feedback.

Given that stronger alpha rhythmicity is associated with increases in inhibitory/excitatory balance, it is expected that alpha-NFB (i) will homeostatically normalize alpha rhythm power and (ii) the degree of normalization will be a dimensional predictor of individual improvement in behavioral and clinical measures of executive function, impulsivity and inattention. These results should lay the foundation for building neurocognitive treatments, by harnessing neuroplasticity mechanisms intrinsic to the brain.",NO,Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity,OTHER: NEUROFEEDBACK|OTHER: CONTROL,"University Hospital, Geneva","University of Geneva, Switzerland",INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",2020-11-02

A total of 60 adult (i.e. age 18-55) smokers (N=40 with ADHD; N=20 without ADHD) who are interested in quitting will be enrolled into a 3-arm trial allocated as follows. Twenty of the ADHD smokers and the 20 non-ADHD smokers will be assigned to a traditional 8-week contingency management intervention in which monetary payments will be made contingent upon biologically verified evidence of smoking abstinence. The 20 additional ADHD smokers will be assigned to a treatment-as-usual condition (nicotine replacement; supportive counseling). During the treatment phase, subjects will be required to answer questions 4x/week in their daily lives via an EMA (Ecological Momentary Assessment).

Specific Aim 1: To assess motivation to quit smoking and readiness for change prior to a quit attempt in treatment seeking ADHD and non-ADHD smokers. Hypothesis 1a: The investigators hypothesize that prior to a quit attempt, smokers with ADHD will exhibit significantly lower levels of intrinsic motivation to quit, and equal or higher levels of extrinsic motivation to quit compared to smokers without ADHD. Hypothesis 1b: The investigators hypothesize that smokers with ADHD will exhibit relatively less readiness for change than smokers without ADHD.

Specific Aim 2: To assess how baseline levels of motivation to quit and readiness for change are influenced during a quit attempt as a function of both ADHD status and treatment modality. Hypothesis 2a. The investigators hypothesize that the CM intervention will result in relatively greater change in extrinsic motivation to quit versus intrinsic motivation to quit, and that this effect will be more pronounced among ADHD smokers. Hypothesis 2b: The investigators hypothesize that overall motivation to quit (intrinsic and extrinsic) and readiness for change will be significantly influenced by the CM intervention versus treatment as usual among ADHD smokers.

Exploratory Aim 1: To assess the relative efficacy of a CM intervention versus treatment as usual in smokers with ADHD. The investigators hypothesize that CM will be more effective for promoting short-term (4-8 weeks) smoking abstinence, as well as for promoting longer-term (3-6 months) smoking cessation.

Exploratory Aim 2: To assess the associations among smoking withdrawal/craving, affect, ADHD symptoms, and motivation to quit/readiness for change.

NCT02039908,Examining Tolerance to CNS Stimulants in ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02039908,COMPLETED,"Although stimulant medication is a well-established treatment for ADHD, it is often necessary for doctors to increase the dose over time to maintain the benefits of the medication. While medication can be very effective for improving symptoms of ADHD during the first year of use, it has not been found to significantly improve the long term course of children with ADHD. For example, in large research studies, groups of children who take medication for ten years do not have consistently better academic grades than groups of children who never used medication (individual results will vary from child to child).

In order to help children with ADHD achieve the best possible outcomes, it is important for doctors to study why this happens. One possible reason is development of tolerance to the medication. Tolerance means that a drug's effects decrease when it is taken consistently over time, so that an increased dose is needed to continue showing effects. Some doctors believe that children who take stimulant medication for ADHD develop tolerance to it which would explain why benefits may not persist over time, but no research studies have been done to measure whether this occurs. This study aims to see if children show a tolerance effect to stimulant medication and whether that tolerance can be prevented by taking short breaks from the medication called medication holidays.",YES,Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,DRUG: Methylphenidate,Florida International University,,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",2013-04

NCT04843423,Adjunct Treatment With Cariprazine for Adults With Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04843423,UNKNOWN,"According to the Canadian ADHD Practice Guidelines, psychostimulants are the preferred treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), especially for those that require urgent care. Specifically, long-acting psychostimulants are considered the gold-standard pharmacological treatment for ADHD. Using extended-release formulations, long-acting psychostimulants provide an extended duration of daily symptom relief in addition to overall reductions in ADHD symptoms that are maintained over time.

In accordance with these guidelines, clinicians may combine psychostimulants with other medications when it is considered necessary. For complex cases, psychostimulants alone are often inadequate for improving the effects of ADHD and are therefore prescribed in conjunction with other medications. At low doses, antipsychotics have been considered appropriate adjunctive medications. Studies show that most adult cases with ADHD that were undiagnosed or untreated in childhood result in the need for adjunctive medication in adulthood to enhance the effects of the psychostimulant.

- Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a functional imaging technique that can be uses light to study brain function while allowing for movement. To look at blood flow in the brain, NIRS uses a low-power light source with detectors that see how the light changes as it passes through brain tissue. Brain blood flow can indicate which parts of the brain are active during different tasks. Researchers want to study children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and will use NIRS to compare the blood flow in the brain of children with ADHD and ASD with that of typically developing children.

Objectives:

* To see how well NIRS can detect changes in brain blood flow during tests of thinking and memory in children.
* To compare blood flow in the brains of typically developing children and those with ADHD or ASD.

Eligibility:

- Children between 4 and 8 years of age with ASD, ADHD, or children with no psychiatric diagnoses.

Design:

* Participants will be screened for eligibility. Those who are taking stimulant medication for ADHD or ASD will need to stop taking it for 3 days before the study visit.
* After participating in a screening assessment, all participants will have one study visit. At this visit, they will have be asked to complete two tasks during a NIRS scan. For both tasks, they will react to images on a computer screen. This visit will last about 2 hours.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent neurobiological brain disorders. Diagnosis of ADHD in adults is complex and subjective. Recent studies give further support for the involvement of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmitters in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Studies show that glutamate (Glu) and GABA change according to stimulant treatment. Measuring modulations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of Glu and GABA may help to explore the pathophysiology of ADHD and give a diagnostic biomarker tool for ADHD in adults.

Aim:

To characterize Glu and GABA levels in the ACC, by using the proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (\[1H\]MRS) system in adults with ADHD compared to healthy control subjects (HCS), before and after stimulant treatment, and to correlate between Glu and GABA levels and clinical symptoms.

Method:

ADHD adults ages 18-40 years (N= 35), and HCS (N= 25), will fill out a DSMV and ASRS questionnaire.

Spectroscopic analyses will be done using 1H MRS (3T) in ADHD adults, before and after stimulant treatment (Methylphenidate /Mixed Amphetamine salts) in an open-label fashion as compared to HCS.

These difficulties have a pervasive negative impact on their everyday functioning and quality of life (QoL). Although pharmacological treatment has been proven effective in treating ADHD symptoms in many children, as have psychosocial interventions such as parent training, there is little evidence for integrative approaches that address the cognitive, volitional and social-environmental barriers to participation with this population. Although preliminary positive effects of a cognitive-function (Cog-Fun) treatment in occupational therapy on this population have been demonstrated, additional evidence is needed to confirm these initial findings. Methods: Initial results of our pilot study (N=17 children with ADHD) demonstrated significant moderate to large effects of Cog-Fun treatment, which targeted participation and executive functions in daily life. Significant effects were also found for a measure of self-efficacy and neuropsychological measures of attention, planning and organization. Parent ratings showed significant reduction of ADHD symptoms and improved QoL. The purpose of the current study is to replicate the pilot study findings in a randomized controlled trial. The study will be a randomized controlled trial with a crossover design, including 2 groups of children with ADHD attending elementary school and their parents. The research group (Group A, n=50) will receive three months of the Cog-Fun treatment, designed for a parent/child dyad and the control group (Group B, n=50) will be wait-listed and receive treatment after three months.

NCT05357495,Characterization and Brain Mechanisms of Frustration in Youth With Severe Irritability or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05357495,WITHDRAWN,"Background:

Irritability is an elevated proneness to anger. Children with irritability have difficulty tolerating frustration. They get angry and have temper outbursts more easily than their others their age. Irritability is a symptom of DMDD and ADHD. (DMDD is disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. ADHD is attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.) Yet the reasons why some children get irritated easily are not well understood.

Objective:

To use brain imaging methods to study responses to frustration in youth.

Eligibility:

Youth aged 8 to 17 years with severe irritability (including those diagnosed with DMDD) and/or ADHD. Healthy volunteers are also needed. All participants are already enrolled in studies 02-M-0021 or 01-M-0192.

Design:

Participants will visit the clinic 3 times. The second and third visits will be 3 to 4 weeks apart.

The first visit will be an enrollment visit. They will receive training on the tasks they will do during the study. Participants and their parents will take surveys. They will answer questions about their moods and feelings.

Participants will train for an MRI scan. They will lie in a mock scanner tube and hear the noises an MRI makes.

On the second and third visits, participants will have real MRI scans. They will play a computer game or watch a movie during each scan. The scans will last about 1 hour.

The week after each scan, participants will wear a device on their wrist to measure their heart rate and activity level. Participants and their parent will use a smartphone to answer questions about how they are feeling and acting. Participants who do not have smartphones will be given one to use during the study.",NO,Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|Normal Physiology,BEHAVIORAL: Affective Posner fMRI frustration induction task,National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: OTHER,2023-01-05

Droxidopa (L-dihydroxyphenylserine (L-DOPS)) is a synthetic catecholamine which is converted to norepinephrine (NE) via decarboxylation, resulting in increased levels of NE centrally in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripherally. Co-treatment with carboxylase inhibitors, such as carbidopa, given with droxidopa, can increase the CNS levels of NE with greater crossing of the blood-brain barrier. Droxidopa has received orphan drug approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in individuals with primary autonomic failure.

NCT01351064,Using Computers to Assist in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01351064,COMPLETED,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed behavioral disorder in children. Prevalence rates in the United States range from 2% to 18% depending on diagnostic criteria and population studied. Primary care physicians, especially pediatricians, have historically played a large role in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. Despite the existence of authoritative guidelines to assist primary care physicians, ample evidence demonstrates that they continue to diagnose and treat this disorder suboptimally. This is due, in part, to a lack of training and cumbersome delivery system designs. Modern computer decision support strategies offer the best hope of equipping general practitioners to deal with the mental health epidemic of ADHD.

The investigators have developed a novel decision support system for implementing clinical guidelines in pediatric practice. CHICA (Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation) combines three elements: (1) pediatric guidelines encoded in Arden Syntax; (2) a dynamic, scannable paper user interface; and (3) an HL7-compliant interface to existing electronic medical record systems. The result is a system that both delivers ""just-in-time"" patient-relevant guidelines to physicians during the clinical encounter, and accurately captures structured data from all who interact with it. Preliminary work with CHICA has demonstrated the feasibility of using the system to implement and evaluate clinical guidelines. The investigators propose to expand CHICA to include ADHD diagnosis and treatment guidelines. The investigators hypothesize that implementation of the ADHD guidelines will result in better outcomes, including higher rates of adherence to recommendations and improved patient functioning.",YES,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,OTHER: CHICA ADHD Module,Indiana University,National Library of Medicine (NLM),INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,2010-07

The available evidence suggest that impaired emotion regulation processes might underlie the aggressive behaviours frequently observed in both disorders. However, no study has yet investigated the presence of disorder-specific characteristics on emotion processing between these two disorders. Different impaired emotion recognition difficulties may underlie the reported emotion dysregulation. A practical implication of this is that given that both disorders have shown difficulties during emotion recognition processes, a short, computer-based intervention to improve emotion recognition might benefit both cases, even though their aetiologies might differ.",NO,Autism Spectrum Disorder|Conduct Disorder,BEHAVIORAL: Emotionen Verstehen und Ausdrücken (E.V.A.),Prof. Christina Stadler,,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2021-04-15

In the foreign literature, many studies bring to light in children and adolescents the negative impact of ADHD on overall quality of life. Some of these studies were able to identify the fact that the higher the age of ADHD children or adolescents, the lower the quality of life. Currently, to our knowledge, only a few European studies have demonstrated the negative impact of ADHD on the quality of life of children and adolescents. In addition, these studies used only questionnaires intended for parents and not for children or adolescents.

During a regular follow-up consultation with their referent child psychiatrist, adolescents accompanied by at least one of their parents will be informed of the modalities of our study. A newsletter will be delivered to parents and one to the adolescent. If neither the adolescent nor the parents is opposed to participate, the child psychiatrist will register the patient on the list of study participants. He will also fill out a medico-social information sheet about the adolescent as to summarize the data in the medical record. At the end of this consultation, in the waiting room, adolescents will answer questionnaires KIDSCREEN-27 and MSPSS; their parents will complete the CBCL questionnaire.

NCT03565250,A Study of Identity Building in Children With ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03565250,UNKNOWN,"Context: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a major public health issue, is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by disturbance of attention, pathological impulsivity and a variable level of psychomotor hyperactivity. In addition to medium-term repercussions such as school failure or family dysfunction, these children have difficulties in dealing with emotions, metacognition and self-awareness that have serious consequences for self-regulation and identity construction.

Objective: To investigate identity building in children with ADHD and explore its links with the severity of the disorder and associated neuropsychological disturbances.

Material and method: 20 childrens with ADHD and 20 controls will be recruited over a 24-month period. They will be administered the Damon and Hart's Self-Understanding Interview, exploring 7 identity domains: Physical, Active, Social, Psychological, Continuity, Agentivity, Distinction Self/Other. The severity of ADHD, neuropsychological functioning (attention, working memory, executive functions, long-term memory), self-esteem and internal/external attributive style (locus of control) will be assessed by validated scales. The overall level of identity development and in each dimension will be compared between patients and controls. Within patients, the correlations between level of identity development and the severity of ADHD will be explored, as well as with neuropsychological functioning, with statistical control of age.

Assumptions: The investigators hypothesize that children with ADHD will exhibit a significantly lower level of identity development than controls, which will be positively correlated with neuropsychological functioning, and negatively correlated with the severity of ADHD.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,OTHER: self understanding interview,"University Hospital, Caen","Institut National de la Santé Et de la Recherche Médicale, France|Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes",INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,2018-07-20

NCT05208255,Effect of Telerehabilitation-Based Exercise and Motor Imagery Training in Children With ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05208255,UNKNOWN,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders with heterogeneous clinical features such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.

It has been shown that one-third of children with ADHD have problems with tasks that require fine and gross motor skills. In addition, it was stated that the motor skill problems experienced during dynamic balance tasks were more pronounced than typically developing children. The motor problems seen in children with ADHD may be caused by dysfunction in some related brain regions that delayed or impaired cerebellar development may contribute to the pathophysiology of ADHD. Motor imagery skills have been investigated as the underlying cause of motor impairment in children with ADHD and Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). Although it has shown that motor imagery is markedly impaired in children with DID; It has been stated that this situation is not clear in children with ADHD. Motor imagery is the mental thinking of a movement without actual movement being revealed.

It has been reported that combined physical and mental programs applied at different rates, as well as motor imagery training without physical exercise, are effective in improving postural control. In a study conducted with children with DCD, it was shown that motor imagery training improves children's movement skills.

In the treatment of ADHD, there are multidimensional treatment approaches that include medical and psychosocial interventions. Pharmacological treatments, including stimulant and non-stimulant drugs, are highly effective in reducing ADHD symptoms and the disruptive behaviours associated with them. Also, physical exercises are known to reduce ADHD symptoms. Exercise methods enable patients receiving drug therapy to respond better to drugs, it has been shown to improve cognitive functions in ADHD cases.

In conclusion, the underlying aetiology of motor imagery skills and motor coordination and balance problems in ADHD is not clear. The use of telerehabilitation methods has become widespread due to the difficulties in conducting face-to-face treatment and follow-up processes during the pandemic process. In addition, there is no exercise program based on telerehabilitation and motor imagery in children with ADHD.

It is expected that the short-term effectiveness of a CBT psychological treatment program of six group sessions will be the same as the response to the CBT psychological treatment program of twelve group sessions in adult ADHD-patients with stable drug treatment.",NO,ADHD,BEHAVIORAL: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),Hospital Vall d'Hebron,,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2016-07-25
NCT05841212,DBT Skills Group for Adolescents With ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05841212,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) is linked to three main symptoms: hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity. It is increasingly being acknowledged that these symptoms have a wide-reaching impact on a person's life. Adolescents with ADHD are six times more likely to be excluded from school, have difficulties turn taking, express anger more often, have poorer emotion regulation and self-report a lower quality of life. In adulthood, people with ADHD are more likely to develop mental health difficulties, and to experience unemployment, divorce and be imprisoned. It is thought that emotion regulation and poor social skills are key factors leading to increases in mental health difficulties and poorer long term social outcomes. This pilot trial will look at whether an intervention which aims to increase emotion regulation and social functioning is acceptable and feasible. The intervention will be an adapted Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) skills group with an ADHD focus. DBT is an approach that aims to provide skills to assist an individual identify what they are feeling and change what they do in response to that feeling. For example, if an individual feels anger and the urge to be aggressive, DBT helps them to problem solve and find a more effective way of responding to their anger. Also, if an individual wants to communicate a relational need to others DBT helps them think about the most effective actions they can take to achieve this outcome. The intervention will be developed in collaboration with adolescents with ADHD. The intervention will then be delivered at the child and adolescent outpatient clinic site they received their diagnosis from. All participants will have a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD. Pre and post measures will be collected and reported on.

NCT00778310,Neuroimaging of the Effects of Concerta in the Treatment of ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00778310,COMPLETED,"A number of brain regions have been down to be altered in both structure and function in patients with ADHD, including prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, caudate and cerebellum. Patients with ADHD often show reduced levels of activity in the frontal and cingulate regions of brain while performing measures of inhibitory control during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While stimulant medications robustly improve the clinical symptoms of ADHD, there are only a small number of studies examining the effects of these commonly prescribed medications on brain activity. We propose to obtain fMRI in patients with ADHD on placebo and on their individualized dose of OROS methylphenidate (Concerta). Our hypothesis is that Concerta will increase the activity of the brain in the frontal, cingulate and amygdala of the brain and that these brain changes will be associated with clinical improvement of symptoms.",YES,Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity,DRUG: methylphenidate-OROS|DRUG: Placebo,The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio,"Ortho-McNeil Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC",INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: ",2008-11
NCT01913912,Event Rate and Effects of Stimulants in ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01913912,WITHDRAWN,"Stimulants alleviate information processing and task performance deficits in Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Long acting formulations of amphetamines such as lisdexamphetamine dimesylate (LDX) are especially valuable as they target the school day and improve classroom performance. Although stimulants have been widely used in treatment of ADHD, the exact mechanism action and effect on task performance is not completely known.

According to the State Regulation Deficit (SRD) model, children with ADHD have difficulty regulating their levels of arousal/activation during tasks in response to the changing demands of the environment. This leads to problems with downregulating overaroused states and upregulating underaroused states. According to this view, stimulants exert their therapeutic effect (in part) by optimising arousal/activation levels - especially during states of underarousal/activation. Arousal/activation levels can also be altered by extrinsic factors such as event rate (ER), e.g., the rate at which information is presented. Multiple studies suggest that very fast and very slow events can both cause problems for individuals with ADHD, related to overarousal and underarousal state respectively. Putting these intrinsic (stimulants) and extrinsic (ERs) factors together leads to the prediction that changing the rate at which information is presented in a task may alter the efficacy of stimulants and affect the optimal stimulant dose level. More specifically, one dose of stimulant that may be optimal on slow ER tasks (as it increases arousal/activation level) may be less effective under high ER tasks because in such a setting arousal/activation level needs to be lowered and not increased further. Adding stimulants to an already overactivated state may exacerbate the associated problems. The implication of this is that a different dose of stimulant will be needed under different environmental conditions for optimal performance. For example, children with ADHD might require different dosage in the classroom setting to optimize performance. In addition, the neuropsychological basis of performance deficits and improvement by ER and stimulants are also unclear. According to the SRD model, the underlying mechanism can be specific problems in motor activation/preparation or effort regulation. Event-related potentials (ERP), pupil size measurements and cardiac measures enable us to see objectively how motor activation/preparation and effort are affected by ER and simulants.

In this study the investigators aim to test these predictions of the SRD model and identify the neurobiological basis of stimulant action.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,DRUG: LDX.|DRUG: sugar pill|DEVICE: computer task (Go/No-Go task)|DEVICE: EEG|DEVICE: pupil size measurements (by using eye tracking),University Ghent,"Fund for Scientific Research, Flanders, Belgium|Shire",INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: OTHER",2014-01

NCT00417781,"A Follow-up, Family Study on Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00417781,COMPLETED,"Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), characterized by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, is an early onset, common (5-10% worldwide; 7.5% in Taiwan), clinically heterogeneous, impairing disorder. Despite the abundance of research on ADHD, the vast majority of samples have been limited to Caucasians; there is limited information about the expressions, patterns, correlates, and outcomes for ADHD in the Taiwanese population.

Specific Aims:

1. to investigate the neuropsychological functioning, and psychiatric, academic, and social outcomes of ADHD at adolescence;
2. to examine the psychopathology and neuropsychological functioning among parents and siblings of ADHD probands;
3. to determine the components of ADHD and neuropsychological functioning with the greatest familial recurrence risks; and
4. to validate the classification of ADHD and comorbid subtypes of ADHD using psychosocial, familial, neuropsychological and longitudinal data.

Subjects and Methods: This 5-year proposal consists of two parts: (1) a 3 year-retrospective cohort study and family study design; and (2) a 2 year-prospective cohort study design. Several Chinese version of rating scales will be prepared in the first 6 months. The sample will consist of probands with (n=180) and without (n=90) ADHD, ages 11-16, recruited from the Children's Mental Health Center, NTUH and an epidemiological study. The ADHD diagnosis has been made 3-6 years ago prior to recruitment. Probands and their parents will be assessed using the following measures (n=810) in the first 3 years. Only probands will be reassessed in the last 2 years. The measures will include a psychiatric interview using K-SADS-E and self-reports covering the individual and familial/environmental domains; and neuropsychological tests (WISC-III, CPT, WCST, CANTAB). The informants include probands and their parents and teachers.

Long-term Objectives: The long-term objectives are to identify the endophenotypes that are close to the biological expression of genes underlying ADHD, to determine the familial aggregation and its specificity regarding the components of ADHD, and neuropsychological deficit, and to identify the impact of ADHD on academic, psychiatric, family, and social outcomes; and to identify a cohort of families with ADHD for future neuroimaging, neurophysiological, and molecular genetic studies.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,,National Taiwan University Hospital,"National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan",OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2005-01

NCT04473755,A Naturalistic Study of Functional Impairment for Individuals With ADHD in the Early Morning and Late Afternoon/Evening Hours,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04473755,COMPLETED,"The objective of this study is to assess the burden and impact of ADHD impairment in the early morning and late afternoon/evening hours for adolescents and young adults. Functional impairments will focus on the currently identified areas of functional impairment in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5, American Psychiatric Association, 2013) - namely, social, academic, and occupational functioning. This is necessary for two reasons: (1) the current literature on ADHD impairment and functioning is concentrated within elementary school children; and (2) studies of intervention effectiveness are typically concentrated during the school day. This current state of the literature ignores the obvious - as ADHD is a chronic disorder, it needs to be addressed as children grow into adolescence and young adulthood, and it needs to be remediated at times outside of the school day such as in the morning and late afternoon/evening.

Therefore, the specific areas assessed in the present study will relate to driving, school, work, and family functioning. These are important areas to study, as the research literature has typically focused on elementary school and school-day behavior in assessments of symptom presentation, impairment, and treatment outcome. As individuals with ADHD grow older, the entire day becomes relevant in determinations of functioning (e.g., workdays may begin in the very early morning or last into the evening/night), and productivity can be assessed across waking hours rather than just across the elementary school day. Once areas of functional impairment in these times of day are determined, for this age group, treatment candidates can aim to address these treatment targets.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,,Florida International University,,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2020-08-04

NCT05863169,fNIRS Neurofeedback in Highly Impulsive Participants With ROI Regions DLPFC and IFG,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05863169,COMPLETED,"The aim of the following study is to investigate which is the best region of interest (ROI) for a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based neurofeedback (NF) training for highly-impulsive individuals (and consequently also patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, ADHD): the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Generally, NF trainings aim to improve the neurophysiological as well as cognitive-behavioral deficits observed in many neuropsychiatric disorders and were shown to constitute an effective complementary treatment option for patients with ADHD. Some previous studies used the DLPFC as a ROI for NF training, while others focused on the IFG as the main target region. However, so far, no study has directly compared the effectiveness of NF trainings targeting the DLPFC vs. IFG using the same protocol or the specificity of regulation efforts between these two areas using fNIRS. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to compare the effectiveness of fNIRS-NF using the DLPFC as a ROI with fNIRS-NF using the IFG as a ROI in a randomized controlled study design with highly-impulsive, healthy participants.

Furthermore, the investigators aim to test the effect of fNIRS-NF training in the context of stress. Previous studies reported that there is a strong connection between ADHD and stress. However, the effect of fNIRS-NF training for the adaptation to stressful situations is uncertain.

To this end, the investigators will assess the brain activity of participants before and after an fNIRS-NF training period during performance of a Go/NoGo task, an n-back task and The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). It is hypothesized that both trainings will be successful in reducing impulsive behavior; however, in the pre/post testing, specific effects of fNIRS-based NF of the DLPFC are expected on working memory function and of fNIRS-based NF of the IFG on inhibitory control (Go/NoGo task).

Background: Parental caregiving for children with special needs is associated with significant stress, potentially impairing parental and familial functioning. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has shown promise in bolstering mental health across diverse populations. Preliminary findings from a feasibility trial (NCT05803252) suggest the potential of FACT in this context.

Methods: Expanding upon prior research, this definitive RCT compares FACT to standard parenting advice, correcting for earlier limitations through increased sample size and rigorous methodology. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, post-intervention (4-8 weeks), and 6-month follow-up.

NCT03440346,Biomarker Research in ADHD: the Impact of Nutrition,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03440346,COMPLETED,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common childhood behavioural disorder, causing significant impediment to a child's development. The exact aetiology of ADHD is still unknown. It is a complex disorder with numerous contributing (epi)genetic and environmental factors. Currently, treatment predominantly consists of behavioural and pharmacological therapy. However, medication use is associated with several side effects and concerns about long-term effects and efficacy exist. Therefore, there is considerable interest in the development of alternative treatment options.

Double-blind research investigating the effect of a few-foods diet (FFD) has demonstrated large improvements in ADHD symptoms. However, following an FFD requires great effort of both the child and parents. To make this treatment easier or potentially obsolete, it is important to understand how and in which children an FFD affects ADHD symptoms.

The investigators hypothesise that an FFD affects brain function and behaviour, including ADHD symptoms, via the complex network of communication between the microbiota, gut and brain, i.e. the MGB axis. The aim of this study is to identify potential mechanism(s) underlying the impact of an FFD on ADHD symptoms and to identify biomarkers that predict the response to the FFD.

100 boys with ADHD will follow the FFD for 5 weeks. After inclusion, all participants will start with a baseline period, during which they will maintain their regular diet. The baseline period ends at the end of week 2. Thereafter, participants will follow a 5-week FFD, preceded by a 1-week transition period. The FFD period ends at the end of week 8.

At the end of the baseline period (i.e. at the end of week 2) and at the end of the FFD (i.e. at the end of week 8), fMRI scans will be made, blood and buccal saliva will be collected, and stool and urine will be handed in. Children will do computer tasks and parents will complete questionnaires to monitor ADHD and physical complaints. All samples will be analysed by researchers blinded to behavioural responses to the FFD. To assess the impact of the FFD on brain function and the MGB axis, associations between ADHD behavioural changes and changes in other primary and secondary study outcomes will be analysed.

This study may lead to the identification of biomarkers that can predict the response to an FFD. Understanding which changes - induced by an FFD - lead to improvements in ADHD symptoms may provide new avenues for developing treatments. Ultimately, the findings may enable personalised intervention strategies based on an individuals' configuration of the MGB axis.",NO,Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder,OTHER: Few-foods diet,Wageningen University,ADHD Research Centre,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,2018-02-19

In a new study, the benefit of noise was shown to be in parity with or even larger than the benefit of pharmacological ADHD treatment on two cognitive tasks, episodic word recall and visuo-spatial working memory task. In the study a group of children diagnosed with ADHD were tested on and off medication, at separate occasions, in noisy vs. silent environments while performing the tasks (Söderlund, Björk et al., 2016).

Participants and recruitment: Participants with an ADHD diagnosis using medication will be recruited from Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in Lund and Malmö. Typically developing children (TDC) and inattentive children without diagnosis will be recruited from schools in collaboration with the municipality.

Experimental design: All participants will perform a double-blind placebo cross over control study. ADHD participants will perform the entire test battery at three occasions with 2-3 weeks intermission in between tests. One occasion with placebo medication and sham SVS stimulation; one occasion with active SVS stimulation; and one occasion with active medication. TD children will only be tested twice while they will not be given any medication or placebo and just perform under SVS vs. sham conditions.

NCT04270812,Treating Sleep in Teens With ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04270812,COMPLETED,"Sleep problems are common in adolescence and recognized as an international public health concern given their links to a range of adverse outcomes. Adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience more sleep problems than their peers, including delayed sleep onset, shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep quality, more sleep variability, and greater daytime sleepiness. Further, research conducted by the investigator's team has shown that sleep problems are strongly associated with - and causal contributors to - functional impairment in adolescents with ADHD, including increased mood, behavior, and academic problems. However, sleep problems are not currently addressed in any evidence-based treatment for adolescents with ADHD, and no study has evaluated an intervention targeting sleep problems in adolescents with ADHD. This is a notable gap in the field since consensus statements on sleep suggest that treating sleep problems may improve ADHD and associated impairments. Evidence-based cognitive-behavioral sleep interventions, including the Transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian Intervention for Youth (TranS-C) intervention, are effective for improving sleep and associated impairments (e.g., attention, mood) in adolescents with sleep problems. However, these interventions have never been tested in adolescents with ADHD specifically.

The DSM-IV ADHD consists of three subtypes: predominantly Inattentive (ADHD-I), predominantly Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (ADHD-H), and Combined subtypes (ADHD-C). Although the DSM-IV field trials indicate that the current subtypes differ significantly on variables such as age of onset, gender ratio, and level of social and academic impairment, little has been addressed whether the DSM-IV subtypes differ neuropsychologically. Numerous researches have proved that stimulants (methylphenidate is the only stimulant in Taiwan) are the most effective medication in treating ADHD. Although the efficacy of methylphenidate on behavioral measures has been established in Taiwan, there is no information about neuropsychological measures.

Specific Aims:

1. to validate ADHD subtype by neuropsychological measures; and
2. to investigate the efficacy of methylphenidate on the improvement of executive functioning among children with ADHD.

Subjects and Methods: Participants will consist of 20 children with ADHD-C, 20 with ADHD-I, 10 with ADHD-H and 50 controls without ADHD in the age range of 7 to 10. The measures include the psychiatric interviews (Chinese K-SADS-E), neuropsychological tests (WISC-III, Cancellation Test, Digit Span, Trail Making Test, CPT, Circle Tracing Test), self-administered rating scale (SNAP-IV), and investigator administered assessment (CGI and Behavior Observation Ratings).

Anticipated Results: We anticipated that children in the ADHD and non-ADHD group will perform differently on the neuropsychological tests with more deficits in neuropsychological functions in the ADHD group. Also, we expected that methylphenidate will improve the performance on the neuropsychological tests and reduce the behavioral symptoms of ADHD children.

NCT05308758,Effect of Game-based HIIT Program on the Executive Function of Children With ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05308758,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common developmental disorder in childhood, with a 5%-6% worldwide prevalence. Children with ADHD often demonstrate impaired executive function, which is closely related to the development of the commonly observed behavioral problems such as inattention, impaired inhibition, and hyperactivity. The purpose of this study is to examine whether a game-based high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program can improve the executive function of children with ADHD, compared with a traditional structured aerobic exercise program and a non-treatment control group.

Methods/design: A total of 42 children with ADHD will be recruited to participate in this three-arm school-based randomized controlled trial. An 8-week specially designed game-based HIIT (GameHIIT) program and a traditional game-based structured aerobic exercise (GameSAE) program will be delivered to those children randomly assigned to these two intervention groups, while the children in the control group will maintain their regular physical activity over the same period. A number of outcome measures including executive function, cerebral hemodynamic response, physical activity, physical fitness, and enjoyment and adherence to the intervention will be assessed for both groups at baseline (T0), immediately after the intervention period (T1), and after the follow-up period (T2).

Discussion: HIIT has recently emerged as a feasible and efficacious strategy for increasing physical health outcomes and cognitive function, including executive function, in healthy young people. However, research has yet to investigate whether the executive function of children with ADHD can be effectively enhanced through HIIT. If, as hypothesized, GameHIIT program improves outcomes for children with ADHD, the present research will inform the development of targeted exercise programs that can be more broadly used with this particular population.

NCT03411434,Added Value of the Oculomotor and Cognitive Examination in the Management of Patients With ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03411434,UNKNOWN,"ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention and / or hyperactivity-impulsivity that affects nearly 6% of school-aged children and persists into adulthood. More and more studies are interested in biomarkers of this pathology. The oculomotricity, which allows to highlight deficits motor and attention present in ADHD, is used routinely in the expert centers. In general, the pharmacological treatment of ADHD is associated with a clinical response in approximately 70% of cases. Today, there is no review to predict the individual response to treatment.

Hypotheses The investigators hypothesize that a precise analysis of the oculomotor markers will allow to measure the improvement of the symptomatology of the ADHD disorder following the introduction of the psycho-stimulatory treatment. In other words, the investigators hypothesize that these markers could be a useful aid in patient follow-up by the clinician and allow early identification of responder and non-responder patients.

Primary objective The main objective of this study is to measure the added value of oculomotor examination in the follow-up of psycho-stimulant-treated ADHD patients.

Main Evaluation Criteria The primary endpoint is oculomotor performance. Parameters analyzed for each saccade are latency, amplitude, duration, average speed, direction.

Secondary Criteria Evaluation (s) Correlations will be established between oculomotor data and scores obtained at the clinical scales assessing ADHD symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity as well as cognitive performance.

NCT03666416,Acute Effects of Exercise in College Students With ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03666416,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"The overall objective of this study is to examine physical exercise as an intervention for ADHD. The rationale for the proposed study is that physical exercise could serve as an effective treatment for college students with ADHD that has low costs, low risks, and ancillary health benefits and may address the limitations of existing treatments. The central hypothesis is that college students with ADHD will exhibit greater degrees of improvement in executive functioning (i.e., sustained attention, working memory) immediately following sprint interval training (SIT), relative to non-ADHD peers. This hypothesis was formulated based on preliminary studies demonstrating reduced ADHD symptoms and improved executive functioning following physical exercise. Multiple 2 (ADHD vs. control) x 2 (male vs. female) x 2 (exercise vs. none) repeated measures ANOVAs will be conducted to compare students with ADHD (n = 24) to controls (n = 24).

The expected outcomes are to confirm this hypothesis and demonstrate the need for further study of physical exercise. If confirmed, the results will provide pilot data for a larger NIH grant proposal aimed at further examining the acute effects of physical exercise (i.e., improved cognitive functioning immediately following exercise) and also the chronic effects of physical exercise (i.e., improved functioning after engaging in regular exercise for an extended period). This outcome is expected to have an important positive impact because physical exercise may serve as an effective treatment for college students with ADHD that is less risky than stimulants, less time-consuming than therapy, and provides ancillary health benefits (i.e., increasing physical fitness, decreasing obesity).",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|Effects of; Exertion|Working Memory|Change in Sustained Attention,BEHAVIORAL: Sprint Interval Training,University of Wyoming,,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2018-10-08

NCT02358941,Neurofeedback and Computerized Cognitive Training in Different Settings for Children and Adolescents With ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02358941,COMPLETED,"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is among the most common childhood-onset psychiatric disorders, with a negative and long-lasting impact on academic achievement, social integration and quality of life. In recent years, the efficacy of non-pharmacological treatments for ADHD, such as neurofeedback training (NF) and computerized cognitive training (CCT), has been at the centre of research. Although an increasing number of well-designed studies have shown that both methods may improve ADHD core symptoms according to parents' ratings, the underlying mechanisms are still a matter of debate. Teachers often report smaller improvements, if any. This has been explained by their lesser involvement in the training. It remains questionable, however, whether other factors may also account for this effect and whether methods other than placebo control may be applied in order to demonstrate the specificity and efficacy of NF and CCT.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate and compare the efficacy of two different computer-based treatment methods for children and adolescents with ADHD, namely NF and CCT, and to examine the impact of different treatment settings, with half of the participants being trained in a clinical setting and the other half at school. The investigators want to show that is feasible to implement NF and CCT in a school setting and that both methods, conducted either at school or in a clinical setting, may lead to significant improvements of ADHD symptoms as well as to specific and differential effects. Besides the differential impact of the settings on informant ratings, the investigators will evaluate the effects of the training methods on neuropsychological and electrophysiological outcome.

NCT01918436,"RCT, Proof of Concept Study of TEAMS (Training Executive, Attention and Motor Skills) Intervention Program",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01918436,UNKNOWN,"Background:

TEAMS (Training Executive Attention and Motor Skills) is a non-pharmacological, neurocognitive intervention program targeted preschool children with ADHD developed by Professor Jeffrey Halperin, and his team from New York University. The uniqueness of this program lies in the concept, based on stimulating neurocognitive growth through focused physical activity and play (Halperin et al.; 2011, 2012, in press).

Teams hypotheses:

TEAMS is based on the notions that:

1. The behavioural manifestations of ADHD are the result of deficient neural networks that affect a wide array of neurocognitive and behavioural processes which are not necessarily identical in all children with the disorder.
2. Neurodevelopment is sensitive to and can be positively affected by appropriate environmental influences.
3. Effective environmental stimulation will be best achieved within a social context.
4. The engagement of the child in the core activities of the treatment must be intrinsically rewarding (i.e., fun) in order to facilitate compliance of the intervention.

The initial research by Halperin et al. (2012)indicated significant improvement in ADHD severity from pre- to post-treatment, which also persisted 3 months later.

Objective: The aim of this study is, through a randomized controlled trial (RCT), to validate the TEAMS treatment program in a clinical setting in Denmark.

Method: Pre-school children age 3-6, from Region Zealand in Denmark, diagnosed with ADHD as primary diagnosis are offered participation in the RCT study of the TEAMS program. The control groups receive the standard treatment program, outlined by the clinical guidelines of Region Zealand. The intervention groups participate in eight weekly group sessions consisting of separate parent- and children's groups.

In the child group the children are introduced to games that are designed to enhance inhibitory control, working memory, attention, visuospatial abilities, planning, and motor skills. The parent group consists of psychoeducation and instructions in how to encourage playing these games with their children and how to support the child's development.",NO,ADHD|Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity,BEHAVIORAL: TEAMS intervention|OTHER: Control group,Holbaek Sygehus,Psychiatry Roskilde|University of Southern Denmark,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2012-10

NCT00936299,Bupropion for ADHD in Adolescents With Substance Use Disorder,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00936299,COMPLETED,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common co-occurring psychiatric disorders (30-50%) in adolescents with substance use disorders (SUD). Yet, little is known about the safety and efficacy of medications for ADHD in adolescents with SUD, since such youths have been excluded from most medication trials. Clinicians are therefore understandably reluctant to treat ADHD in substance abusing adolescents, often first referring such youths to substance treatment. Untreated ADHD is associated with poorer substance treatment outcomes. We address this research gap by proposing a randomized controlled trial of bupropion vs placebo in 130 adolescents (13-19 years) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM IV) ADHD, nicotine dependence and cannabis use disorder (not excluding other SUD). Participants in both bupropion and placebo treatment groups will receive weekly individual manualized-standardized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting SUD (at no cost to them) throughout the 16 weeks of the medication trial. Bupropion also is effective in treating nicotine dependence in adults; the majority of adolescents with marijuana and other drug abuse also smoke tobacco. More recent research in adults indicates that bupropion may reduce craving and use of other substances of abuse (e.g. methamphetamine, cocaine).

Sleep difficulties, including prolonged sleep onset latency and decreased total sleep time have a significant negative impact on the functioning of children. In adults, sleep deprivation may result in drowsiness and yawning. However, in children, this may manifest as mood and behavioural disturbances which may even mimic the classic symptoms of ADHD; hyperactivity, poor impulse control, and inattention. This can in turn negatively affect the day to day activities of a child such as social interactions and learning. A meta-analysis in 2015 showed that stimulant medications impair sleep of children and adolescents. Some researchers have argued that stimulant medication may improve sleep. Importantly there appears to be heterogeneity in the effects of stimulant medication on sleep with some people sleeping better and some people worse after taking Foquest®. Although the randomized controlled trials done to date have demonstrated the efficacy and outlined the safety profile of Foquest, there remains some unanswered questions about the practical implications in the real-world setting. Some clinicians have raised the concern, for example, that the extended duration of Foquest, may have a negative impact on sleep. This study will evaluate the effect of Foquest® on sleep and particularly sleep latency and self and parent reported sleep restorative quality.

NCT02209116,Assessing QbTest Utility in ADHD: A Randomised Controlled Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02209116,COMPLETED,"Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)is one of the most common mental health disorders of childhood. Children with ADHD often have poor attention, are restless and hyperactive and show impulsive behaviour.

It is important to detect ADHD so young people can have access to appropriate clinical interventions.

One of the most common ways ADHD is assessed is through the clinician's opinion; however, this can vary between clinicians and is thought to be one reason why ADHD may be mis-diagnosed. Using a more objective computer tasks may help improve our understanding of ADHD. One computer task is the QbTest.

The test presents different symbols to the child, and the child has to respond by pressing a button only when a target symbol appears. The test measures the child's attention, impulsivity and movement whilst doing this task.

Although the test is thought to be a valid measure, more research needs to be conducted on this measure to see whether it helps clinicians decision making.

To see whether this test helps clinicians make a diagnosis of ADHD and helps with medication decisions, children and young people will be asked to complete the task as part of their initial assessment for ADHD. Half the participants and their clinician will have access to the QbTest result; the other half will not have access to the QbTest result until the end of the study.

Participant's parents, teachers and the clinician will also be asked to complete some questionnaires about the child's symptoms and behaviour. If the child is diagnosed with ADHD and is given medication they will be asked to complete the task again on medication. The same set of questionnaires will be completed by the parents/teachers/clinicians.

NCT05182424,Randomized Controlled Trial of the Myndlift BPT App,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05182424,UNKNOWN,"We propose addressing these aims by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will evaluate the hybrid BPT (Myndlift BPT) compared to a wait-list control group. All participants will receive the Myndlift BPT at either the initial point of randomization or following the wait-list time period.

The Myndlift BPT consists of 10, self-directed app-based BPT modules accessible through an online mobile application with each module requiring up to 30 minutes of parent's time. Therapist contact (""parent-therapist consults"") will be based on parent need. We anticipate approximately six standard 20-minute therapist contacts during the Myndlift BPT (one prior to the start of the app-based BPT modules, four parent-therapist consults during the app-based BPT modules, and one final parent-therapist consult at the end of app-based BPT modules). Additional parent-therapist consults will be based on parents' needs. In addition, therapists will monitor parent progress and challenges with the app-based BPT modules using a web-based therapist portal. The therapist may initiate additional parent-therapist consults if s/he deems it necessary based on client progress, and contacts can be longer than 20 minutes if needed. All consults are completed through Zoom telehealth platform.

Given the self-directed nature of the Myndlift BPT (parents decide how frequently they access the app-based modules of BPT and practice the skills), parent involvement in the intervention will vary slightly in duration. However, based on the literature and routine practice, we anticipate parents completing one module/week in the app-based parent feature for a total of 10 weeks with an additional therapist supported session at the start of the intervention and one at the end of the intervention for a total of 12 weeks of involvement in the Myndlift BPT. The research assessment (see details below) will occur at baseline and at the end of Myndlift BPT.

NCT05635318,Quantitative EEG Neurofeedback as an Add-on Therapy For Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05635318,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurological disorder in children, mainly manifesting as attention deficit, excessive hyperactivity, and impulsivity. It is a chronic condition that affects millions of children and often continues into adulthood.

The prevalence of ADHD in the worldwide is approximately 5%, predominantly occurring in boys, and more than half of patients continue to experience symptoms into adulthood. Children with ADHD have moral disorders and learning difficulties, and these factors will seriously affect their academic achievements and familial and social relationships; thus, treatment is necessary.

Currently, the treatment for ADHD is usually pharmacological intervention, such as methylphenidate, Atomoxetine.... etc. However, research has suggested that pharmacological intervention has side effects on nervous system development in children, and the long-term efficacy is uncertain. In recent years, the efficacy of neurofeedback (NF) therapy, as a type of biofeedback method, has been proven in many diseases, such as mild cognitive impairment, epilepsy, and autism, depression, and anxiety.

NF converts signals such as EEG into visual or auditory information, and then subjects selectively enhance or inhibit certain components through training. There are three common NF protocols for ADHD: theta/beta training, sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) training, and slow cortical potentials (SCP) training. This study adopts the theta/beta NF protocol. As a promising nonpharmacological alternative treatment for ADHD, the efficacy of NF has been proven in many studies.

The use of quantitative EEG neurofeedback as an add-on therapy can be markedly beneficial to shorten the period of pharmacological treatment and with minimal side effects.",NO,ADHD,DEVICE: FDA approved medications for ADHD plus Quantitative EEG Neurofeedback|DRUG: FDA approved medications for ADHD,Assiut University,,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",2023-01-01

- The risk for becoming addicted to drugs varies from person to person, even among those who use similar drugs in a similar way. Studies suggest that certain personality traits seen in people with drug addiction may be present before drug use. These traits include responding differently to rewards or impulsivity. Early use of drugs (before age 15) is also associated strongly with drug addiction later in life. Researchers want to study teenagers with and without certain behavioral problems, including those who have used drugs and those who have not. This may help them better understand behaviors that might predict future drug addiction.

Objectives:

- To understand brain function in teenagers who may be at a higher risk than others to drug addiction.

Eligibility:

* Teenagers between 13 and 17 years of age who fit into one of four groups:
* Have never or rarely used drugs
* Have never or rarely used drugs and have conduct or behavior disorders
* Have used drugs on many occasions
* Have used drugs on many occasions and have conduct or behavior disorders

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a medical history, and physical and neurological exams. They will also have blood and urine tests. Participants will answer questions about past drug use and any current medications. They will also have a breathalyzer and carbon monoxide breath test to check for recent drug and alcohol use.
* This study requires four visits to the clinical center for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and other tests.
* The first study visit will include training for the MRI scans. Participants will practice the tasks in front of a computer and in a mock (fake) MRI machine. Participants will also be asked several questions about their personality and past experiences.
* Researchers will test changes to tryptophan and dopamine levels. Both of these chemicals affect decision making and brain function. On the three study visits, participants will have the following tests in a randomly selected order. One study will be done at each visit.
* MRI scans with changes to dopamine and tryptophan levels
* MRI scans with changes to dopamine only (with placebo)
* MRI scans with changes to tryptophan only (with placebo)

NCT01176136,Organizational Skills Interventions for Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01176136,COMPLETED,"Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed childhood disorders, with prevalence rates estimated at 8% (Froehlich et al. 2007). Several of the primary symptoms of ADHD relate to problems with temporal and materials organization (i.e. often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities, often loses things, is often forgetful, and often fails to finish school-work, chores, or duties; APA, 2000). In the school setting, problems with organization manifest as forgetting to complete or losing homework assignments, difficulties planning for the completion of long-term projects and studying for tests, and problems keeping class materials organized. These organizational difficulties become particularly problematic in middle school and can result in considerable academic impairment (Evans, Serpell, \& White, 2005). Children with ADHD underachieve academically and are more likely than their peers to receive failing grades, be retained and to drop out of school (Barkley, Fischer, Edelbrock, \& Smallish, 1990).

Given the relationship between temporal and materials organization and poor school performance, it is clear there is a need for interventions to address these difficulties. We recently sought to address this need by completing a small randomized trial of an organizational skills intervention for children with ADHD (Langberg, Epstein, Urbanowicz, Simon, \& Graham, (2008). The intervention was highly effective in improving materials organization and homework management and resulted in significant improvements in homework problems and grade point average. These results demonstrate the considerable promise of organizational skills interventions for children with ADHD. However, the Langberg et al. intervention was implemented as an after-school program operated by research staff with minimal involvement from school personnel. In order to promote the widespread adoption of interventions that address the organizational skills deficits of children with ADHD, the intervention must be feasible for school counselors and psychologists to implement within the time constraints of a typical school day. Accordingly, the primary goal of this study is to adapt and refine the existing intervention protocol (Langberg et al., 2008) to create a product that is highly acceptable to parents, children, teachers, school counselors and school psychologists and is feasible for school personnel to implement during the school day.

In Phase I of the proposed research, middle school counselors, psychologists, teachers, middle school students with ADHD and their parents will consult with the intervention developers to modify the after-school treatment protocol for in-school implementation. An intervention protocol will be developed. The intervention will be piloted with ten children in order to identify barriers to implementation. Measures of treatment fidelity, skills acquisition, and satisfaction will be completed. These data will inform additional modifications of the protocol and further improve feasibility/acceptability of the intervention procedures.

In Phase II of the study, school counselors/psychologists from at least four separate school districts will implement the protocol developed in Phase I. Using a waitlist control design, sixty children with ADHD in grades 6, 7, and 8 will receive the intervention. Organizational skills, grade point average, and academic impairment will be evaluated at baseline, post intervention and at 8-week follow-up. After implementing the intervention, all participants (i.e., teachers, counselors, psychologists, children and parents) will participate in a series of focus groups and will complete intervention satisfaction questionnaires. These data will inform final revisions to the intervention protocol. The resulting product will be an intervention that targets organizational skills in children with ADHD that has potential for widespread school-based dissemination. The final intervention protocol and effect size estimates from the proposed research will lay the foundation for an IES Goal III test of efficacy.

The specific aims of the project are as follows:

1. Utilize the existing organizational skills intervention protocol (Langberg et al. in press), focus group and case study data to develop an empirically and clinically informed manualized temporal and materials organization intervention for middle school children with ADHD aimed at reducing academic impairment (Phase I).
2. Refine and finalize the intervention protocol through a waitlist control trial (N=60) in a minimum of four diverse school districts, collection of clinical outcomes and completion of follow-up focus groups to assess satisfaction, feasibility, and acceptability (Phase II).",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,"BEHAVIORAL: Homework, Organization, and Planning Skills (HOPS) Intervention","Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati",,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2010-09

Many patients in psychiatric care have sleep problems including insomnia, but are rarely given the choice to participate in CBT to improve their sleep. Patients with ADHD is a patient group with high levels of sleep difficulties. Sleep problems in this patient group can be both more general such as insomnia, but can also be related to the ADHD itself and to the use of ADHD medication. In a previous pilot study, the investigators developed a version of CBT-i that would target sleep problems in this population. The basis was CBT-i, but with more emphasis on sleep promoting behaviors specific to ADHD (e.g. appropriate timing of ADHD-medication), techniques that would also alleviate sleep phase problems, (e.g. the systematic use of light and darkness), and techniques to target more general sleep disturbing habits (e.g. not winding down before bed time), that are also common in patients with ADHD. This treatment was well tolerated and gave moderate effects on insomnia severity in the pilot study.

The number of ADHD cases has increased, possible due to heightened awareness of the condition. There are large prevalence differences, potentially due to variations in assessments procedures. Many clinicians and parents view the diagnostic process as too extensive, taking time from treatment and interventions. In addition, assessments may be perceived as too focused on diagnostic criteria to be fully helpful. Systematic research on how assessment procedures can be optimized is essentially lacking. It is largely unknown whether brief protocols including medical history, diagnostic interview, and rating scales differ from comprehensive protocols that also encompass neuropsychological testing regarding validity, reliability, patient satisfaction and cost-effectiveness. Further, feasible biomarkers (e.g. heart rate variability, pupil dilation and the pupillary light reflex) of the autonomic nervous system have been proposed as indicators of diagnostic status. The aim of this study is to gain knowledge about diagnostic processes to enable valid, reliable, and cost-effective ADHD assessments. Using a randomized controlled trial design (N = 240 children, 8-17 years, referred to child and adolescent psychiatric units), differences between a brief and a comprehensive ADHD assessment protocol regarding assessment outcome, reliability, validity, patient satisfaction, and future outcome taking gender into account will be examined.

Exclusion criteria: participants with an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) below 70 as estimated by referring 3-C clinical staff, or any history of psychosis.

Procedures (methods): This research will use a demographic and background collecting survey to gather relevant data about each participant. Parents will be asked to fill out a baseline ADHD Rating Scale-IV: Home Version (ADHD-RS), to account for their child's symptoms of ADHD over the past 6 months.

NCT04860024,Epigenetics in ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04860024,COMPLETED,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is among the most common psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. ADHD's nosology is largely based on clinical phenomenology that includes such symptoms as inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. However, a reliable ADHD biomarker has still not been determined either for differential diagnosis or for monitoring treatment effects. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that function in the process of RNA silencing and the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. MiRNAs are found in abundance throughout the nervous system and play a vital role in the transcriptional networks with regards to human brain development. Currently, miRNAs' involvement in the pathogenesis of ADHD continues to be unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the prospective role of miRNAs in ADHD and to determine whether miRNA levels in peripheral blood can serve as a biomarker and a diagnosis panel for ADHD.

In the preliminary study, blood samples were collected from five patients with ADHD and five healthy control subjects. The use of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques has identified 23 miRNAs as potential biomarkers for ADHD. During this three-year proposal, we intend to recruit 100 drug-naïve patients with ADHD and 100 age- and gender-matched control subjects (Training Set). Blood will be obtained through direct puncture of the vein from each participant to analyze the miRNAs by using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The behavior and neuropsychology of each participant will be assessed. This research will construct a miRNAs diagnosis panel using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model to discriminate ADHD from non-ADHD. The validity of the miRNA diagnosis panel will then be re-examined using an independent validation sample composed of 50 patients with ADHD and 50 control subjects (Testing Set). All of the 150 patients with ADHD will receive treatment in a traditional clinical practice and then will be followed up with for 12 months. At the twelfth month, the same procedures as those performed at the baseline will be replicated to examine the influence of ADHD medications on miRNAs, as well as determine whether miRNAs can serve as a biomarker to portray the condition of ADHD under treatment. MiRNA target gene prediction and functional annotation analysis will also be performed.

This study will develop a potential diagnostic panel for ADHD through the use of combinations of multiple miRNA expressions. We will provide proof of the relationships of miRNAs profiles and ADHD manifestations in clinical samples and further explain the molecular pathogenesis of ADHD.

NCT02566824,Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adolescents With Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02566824,UNKNOWN,"Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood psychiatric condition, which often persists into adolescence. In adolescence ADHD is associated with poor academic, social, and emotional functioning, other psychiatric problems, substance abuse, and antisocial behaviour. Although medication effectively reduces symptoms such as hyperactivity and inattention, it does not directly address academic, social, emotional, and behavioural problems. Overcoming these would require building skills in organization, time management, problem solving, emotional modulation, stress management and interpersonal rapport. Yet, psychosocial treatments targeting such skills in adolescents with ADHD have been little studied and are scarce in the community. The proposed study will evaluate cognitive behavioural and skills training therapy (CBT+S) for adolescents with ADHD. Adolescents will decide whether they want to take medication to treat their ADHD symptoms. If they choose to be on medication, they will be stabilized on optimized medication and randomly assigned to 12 sessions of either manualized group cognitive behavioral and skills training therapy (CBT+S) or manualized supportive group therapy (SGT). An additional treatment-as-usual group will also be included. CBT+S will focus on skill acquisition in common problem areas for adolescents with ADHD, such as organization and time management, distractibility, impulsivity, and social skills. A coach will call each participant twice a week to help practice the learned skills.

Parallel groups will be provided for parents of CBT+S and SGT participants focusing on education, support and sharing experiences.

Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often have cognitive problems. It may be hard for them to control their behaviors, concentrate for long periods, or make decisions. This can affect their education, friendships, and daily life. Virtual reality-based games may help improve cognitive skills in children with ADHD. It may also help change how the brain functions.

Objective:

To see if virtual reality-based games help improve thinking skills and brain function in children with ADHD.

Eligibility:

Children aged 10 to 16 years with ADHD.

Design:

We will first do a pilot study, meaning that everyone will receive the games. If this is successful, we will then conduct a randomized controlled trial, meaning that some participants will be randomly assigned to the full version of the games and some will be randomly assigned to a limited version. Participants will be screened. Their physical and mental health, medical and family history, and intellectual and emotional development will be evaluated. They will have tests of their mood, memory, attention, thinking, and behavior. Blood or saliva may be collected. Participants may have an MRI scan of the brain.

Participants will receive a set of virtual reality games. The set includes 4 different games all played using a virtual reality headset. The participant will play the games for 20 minutes 5 days a week for 4 weeks.

The parent or caregiver will start each game using an iPad. Each of the games is designed to help the participant practice specific cognitive skills. These include inhibition control, processing speed, temporal information processing, and working memory.

Participants will have interviews each week. They will answer questions about motion sickness, eye strain, headache, and any other side effects, as well as number of game sessions played.

Blood or saliva tests and the MRI may be repeated after the last game session. For the pilot, participants will have a final interview at the study end.

These risk behaviors are a major public health problem in France and worldwide.

Cannabis is the first illicit drug consumed by adolescents in France. His experimentation progresses rapidly between 11 and 17 years. The relationship between cannabis use and mental health has been shown by several studies. In particular Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), characterized by attention deficit, impulsivity and disabling motor hyperactivity and beginning before 12 years of age (DSM-5), is a major risk factor for the consumption of cannabis. ADHD is a common condition (9% of children and 5% of adults), but often undiagnosed or untreated. It has been shown that the treatment of ADHD in childhood protects the consumption of psychoactive products during adolescence or adulthood.

ED is characterized by excessive and inappropriate emotional reactions compared to social norms, uncontrolled and rapide shifts in emotion and attention focused on emotional stimuli.

According to research, there are strong correlations between personality traits and psychiatric disorder as ADHD. In a longitudinal study, the persistence of ADHD symptoms during adolescence is associated with high neuroticism, low agreeableness and low conscience. Studies show that these personality traits are factors of vulnerabilities for comordities associated with ADHD and are predictive of overall functioning difficulties. Studies show correlations between ADHD in childhood and personality disorders at adulthood .

ADHD is frequently associated with emotional dysregulation (ED) that is characterized by an inability to modulate emotional responses in a given context . ED is observed in 24% to 50% children with ADHD . Children with ADHD and ED are more likely to present a severe and complex symptomatology and are at risk for antisocial and bordeline personality disorders than children without ED. To date, there would be no studies which would have been interested in personality traits in children with ADHD and ED.

The main objective is to determine if children with ADHD and ED present from childhood traits of personality as low agreeableness, low conscience and high neuroticism that are predictive of personality disorders at adulthood. It would involve earl identification of children at increased risk of pejorative developmental trajectories.

The second objectives are:

NCT01133418,Cognitive Training Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01133418,COMPLETED,"Currently, only two treatment modalities for pediatric attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are considered evidence-based: (1) pharmacological and (2) behavioral treatment. Recently, several studies have shown promising results suggesting efficacy for cognitive training interventions for children with ADHD. These interventions directly train cognitive function (i.e., attention, working memory) by having children practice cognitive skills using computerized tasks. In these studies, improvements related to the cognitive training intervention have been documented on neuropsychological tests, academic tasks, and parent ratings of children's ADHD behavior. Given the ubiquitous finding of increased reaction time (RT) variability among children with ADHD, the candidate worked with a group of developers to modify a cognitive training intervention to target RT variability. That is, train the children to be less variable in their responding. Initial clinical data from this intervention suggest that intervention exposure improves behavioral outcomes. However, an appropriate powered randomized clinical trial is necessary to experimentally demonstrate intervention efficacy.Sixty-four (64) children diagnosed with ADHD (either Predominantly Inattentive Type or Combined Type) will be randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. Children in the intervention group will receive 8 weeks of the Computerized Progressive Attention Training (CPAT) intervention. Children in the control group will receive the CPAT intervention but there will be no progression in difficulty based on performance as in the intervention group. Children in both groups will be assessed pre-intervention and immediately after the 8-week training on neuropsychological, behavioral, and academic outcome measures. Hypothesis-driven data analyses will assess intervention efficacy.

Hypothesis #1: Children in the experimental group exposed to the CPAT intervention will show greater improvement from pre- to post-intervention on neuropsychological tests compared to children in the control group.

The most common sleep difficulties in adolescents with ADHD are initial insomnia, nocturnal awakenings, non-restorative or restless sleep. These difficulties seem to be causally related to increased ADHD symptom impairment, oppositional and depressive symptomatology, and functional impairments in daily life, resulting in a vicious circle of sleep problems and impairment. Thus, reducing sleep problems is an important intervention target. However, to date there is no evidence-based cognitive behavioral sleep treatment available. Sleep-focused treatments need adaptation towards this developmental phase/disorder for effectiveness, as ADHD and sleep problems are bi-directional. Therefore, a blended treatment targeting the core deficits integrating motivational interviewing, planning skills and sleep interventions is needed.

When psychotherapy and family therapy is unsuccessful, medications are often used. Current medications are stimulants (e.g. methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine), anticonvulsants (e.g. Divalproex) and antipsychotics (olanzapine, risperidone). At this time, the available medications are of limited usefulness, either because they do not always work or because they have side effects such as weight gain or insomnia. There is a clear need for new medications to treat explosive aggression when psychotherapy is unsuccessful.

The hypothesis of this study is the medication Intuniv when combined with psychotherapy will be more helpful to children with explosive aggression than placebo combined with psychotherapy.

NCT04279158,Attention Modulation of Local and Global Inhibition Mechanisms,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04279158,RECRUITING,"Human behavior is both flexible and adapted to the environmental context through inhibition capabilities; the investigator control the subject's behavior by repressing inappropriate responses and selecting, among several possibilities, those that are appropriate. These mechanisms are not independent of attentional control. Attention acts as a selection filter for the investigator's behavior. This leads us to hypothesize that attention modulates the mechanisms of inhibition. Nevertheless, the different brain structures involved, as well as mechanisms underlying the interaction between inhibition and attention remain largely unknown.

Previous research has suggested that inhibition requires selective attention and, conversely, attentional mechanisms would result in the ""deselection"", or inhibition, of objects in space or irrelevant actions. Reconciling the literature on attention with the one on inhibition appears fundamental for the understanding of the instance to which the mechanisms of inhibition and the cognitive processes interact. Therefore, the goal of this research project will be to investigate how inhibition mechanisms are implemented in the brain and, in more detail, what determines the type of resulting inhibitory control: spatially localized or global. The investigator will test 3 different patient groups (optic ataxia, hemispatial neglect and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) compared to control.

NCT02105142,Comparative Effectiveness of Primary Care-based Interventions for Pediatric ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02105142,COMPLETED,"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioral disorder of childhood, affecting approximately 8% of youth. Children with ADHD often have problems sustaining attention and completing multi-step commands and tasks of daily living, such as homework. Pediatricians are often the first physicians to identify problems with children's functioning at home and at school. However, because of limited visit time, pediatricians often struggle with managing ADHD while trying to also cover a vast array of other primary care issues. Moreover, as there is a nationwide shortage of pediatric mental health specialists and access to parenting programs is limited, a critical need exists to develop interventions that form partnerships between behavioral and mental health specialists and the primary care pediatrician. One approach is to base interventions in the pediatric clinic to ensure children have access to appropriate treatment. Thus far, only a limited number of sites have this pediatric-mental health partnership.

Health information technology (HIT) has been used to enhance primary care management of ADHD. HIT can improve pediatricians' ability not only to adhere to recommended guidelines, but also to screen for co-existing disorders and provide timely parental education. An alternative strategy might be to use group visits (GV). GV afford more time with families and allows the pediatrician to facilitate more in-depth discussions. More importantly, the group model allows parents to learn from one another, normalizes parenting expectations, and addresses shared experiences of medication side effects and other factors related to adherence. Moreover, a group visit can be conducted in a physical location, such as the pediatric clinic, or be brought into the virtual world with the aid of social media. Virtual support groups for chronic care diseases have become an increasingly popular way for a community of individuals to exchange information and offer emotional support.

Prior to the adoption of these interventions into primary care practice, investigators must know which is best. Rigorous comparative effectiveness research (CER) can help to determine this. This proposal will compare a HIT based intervention to a GV strategy, with and without the use of social media. These 3 interventions will be compared based not only on clinical measures of interest but also on parent-defined patient outcomes. Prior research has largely focused on measuring clinical outcomes such as treatment adherence and ADHD symptom reduction with little emphasis on understanding how patient-centered outcomes, such as the quality of life of families dealing with ADHD, are affected.

Building on previous work, the specific aims for this study are:

Aim 1. Compare the preliminary efficacy of three interventions to improve treatment of ADHD in the primary care setting Aim 1a) Compare the effectiveness of the three interventions on clinical measures such as parent and teacher rated ADHD symptoms and adaptive functioning Aim 1b) Compare the effectiveness of the three interventions on patient-centered outcomes such as quality of life and parental satisfaction with the intervention The three interventions will be: 1) Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation (CHICA) which is the health information technology innovation arm; 2) Group visits (GV); or 3) Group visits plus online discussion portal (GV+DP).",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,BEHAVIORAL: ADHD Group Visits|BEHAVIORAL: ADHD Group Visits plus Online Discussion Portal|BEHAVIORAL: Computer Decision Support,Indiana University,Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ),INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,2014-04

This study will compare adolescents with ADHD to adolescents not diagnosed with ADHD and their performance on a number of social inference and communication tests. This study hypothesizes that persons with ADHD will not perform as effectively as control participants on the social inference and communication tests, and will evidence lower WM score.

Its treatment includes the combination of multiple daily glucose measurements, insulin administration and balanced nutrition. The goals of therapy are to achieve glycemic control (HbA1c \< 7.5%), and minimal glycemic excursions. Furthermore, recent studies imply that keeping HbA1c within target range is not sufficient to prevent complications, attributed mainly to blood glucose level fluctuating from high to low, associated with food intake and adolescents behavior. The current implication of glycemic control on the central nervous system (CNS) includes abnormal electrical brain activity, structural changes in brain's white and grey matter, and cognitive impairment. Still, little is known on the effect of sleep pattern, including circadian rhythm reversal (""biological clock) on asymptomatic glycemic excursions, and on CNS functions. There is no data regarding the association of the biologic clock on CNS functionality among adolescents, nonetheless among T1DM adolescents, for whom behavior and circadian rhythm alterations may have harmful effect. The investigators propose a cross-over designed study by examining adolescents with and without T1DM during 2 weeks of regular sleeping pattern (night sleep), and during 2 weeks of sleeping during the day as happens during summer vacation.

NCT05425966,Adapting a Web-Based Professional Development for Mexican School Mental Health Providers Delivering Evidence-Based Intervention for ADHD and ODD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05425966,COMPLETED,"Neurodevelopmental disorders of inattention and disruptive behavior, such as Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), are among the most common youth mental health conditions across cultures. An efficacious and feasible solution to improving affected youth's ADHD/ODD is training existing school clinicians to deliver evidence-based intervention with fidelity. Despite initial promising results of training school clinicians to treat ADHD/ODD in settings suffering from high unmet need, such as Mexico, scalability is limited by a lack of researchers with capacity to train, monitor, and evaluate school clinicians in such efforts on a large scale. Thus, there is a need to develop more feasible interventions and training programs for school clinicians, as well as create a system with capacity for scalable training and evaluation, to combat the widespread impact ofADHD/ODD worldwide. Converting interventions and school clinician professional development programs for fully-remote delivery allows for more flexibility, accessibility, affordability, scalability, and promise for ongoing consultation than in-person options. Supporting scalable training for school clinicians could address a significant public health concern in Mexico, as only 14% of Mexican youth with mental health disorders receive treatment and less than half of those treated receive more than minimally adequate care. The study team is uniquely suited for this effort, given that they developed the only known school-homeADHD/ODD evidence-based intervention in Latin America-and-have developed a web-based training for U.S. school clinicians with promising preliminary results. The study team's prior studies and high levels of unmet need make Mexico an ideal location for this proposal; however, lessons learned could be used to expand scalable school clinician training for evidence-based intervention in other settings and/or for other disorders. Thus, this study focuses on conducting an open-trial of the fully-remote program and make iterative changes.

NCT05718427,"Effect of ASI on Sensory, Motor, Cognitive, Behavioral Skills and Social Participation in Children With ADHD",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05718427,RECRUITING,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a very common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood characterized by short attention span, impulsivity and hyperactivity. It is also known that sensory integration problems are seen together with the basic symptoms of ADHD. Studies indicate that children with ADHD have difficulties in perceiving and processing sensory stimuli, and in relation to this, they have difficulty in producing appropriate sensory responses at school, at home and in social environments. However, it was observed that the interventions related to ADHD did not focus on the sensory-motor dimension enough, and focused more on cognitive or social skills. Although current research indicates the presence of sensory integration disorder in children with ADHD, there are no studies showing the effectiveness of sensory integration intervention. Our study was planned to examine the effect of Ayres Sensory Integration intervention on sensory-motor, cognitive, behavioral skills and social participation in children with ADHD.

NCT03060291,Prevention of Substance Use in At-Risk Students: A Family-Centered Web Program,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03060291,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based version of the Family Check-up (FCU). The FCU is a school-based family-centered intervention that has been developed over the past 20 years and tested across the United States with diverse populations. It focuses on enhancing parenting skills and family management in early adolescence. The FCU has been shown to be highly effective at reducing adolescent problem behavior, achievement problems, depression, and substance use over an extended period of time.

In the original FCU, parents complete an assessment that evaluates family strengths and challenges. They then receive feedback from a family consultant about how their data compare to other families with children of the same age. As part of this feedback session, the consultant helps motivate parents to make changes at home that will positively impact their child and family overall. Parents and consultants decide together which child behaviors they most want to see change. The consultant then works with parents to enhance relevant parenting and family management skills.

Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of this intervention, few schools have the resources and staffing to implement it without substantial support. It seems, then, that schools would benefit from an online package that requires fewer school resources to implement. The FCU-Online is designed to incorporate the successful components of the original FCU while reducing the burden on schools. And, because it is accessed online, parents can utilize this resource at a time and location convenient to them.

In this study, 300 families will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a web/ mobile-only version of the FCU, a web/mobile + coach version, or middle school as usual. Research on mental health interventions delivered over the internet suggests that a coach or ""in-person"" contact enhances outcomes. However, programs that require no coaching or in-person contact are cheaper and easier for schools to deliver. Therefore, a web/ mobile-only version may allow more schools to deliver the intervention to a greater number of families and children. Thus, investigators will test the relative effectiveness of a coach version versus an online-only version at improving key parenting skills. It is predicted that changes in parenting will lead to reductions in risk behavior, such as problem behavior at school and substance use.",YES,Substance Use|Conduct Disorders in Adolescence|Depression|Anxiety,"BEHAVIORAL: FCU-Online, web/ mobile only|BEHAVIORAL: FCU-Online, web/ mobile + coach",University of Oregon,National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA),INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION,2017-02-21

NCT04378517,Evaluating the Feasibility of FAM-SOTC Intervention for Families of Adolescents With ADHD: Pilot Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04378517,COMPLETED,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is a highly genetic and complex neurological disorder, where disruptive behavior, emotional imbalance, and lack of attention can interrupt with normal development of adolescents, self-awareness, and self-regulation in a way that has an impact on the family unit. Effective family intervention programs, that empower resilience and strength, to cope with the stressful situation from ADHD, are therefore needed. Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge regarding what type of interventions are the most effective for these families. As well as, little is known about the benefits of family-level intervention for families of adolescents with ADHD at outpatient care and what amount of combination in an intervention is appropriate. Psychiatric advanced practical nurse (APN) practitioners are in a key role to offer such an intervention. Therefore, the aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of offering a family-level intervention, for parents of 13-17 years old adolescents with ADHD, at a Children and Adolescents' Psychiatric Outpatient Unit (BUGL). Also, to evaluate if the intervention, which consists of group educational sessions, family sessions, and access to evidence-based information's on ADHD, fitted the families.

A nurse-led educational and support intervention will be offered for parents of adolescents with ADHD once a week over a 5-week time period. First, there will be offered three group support sessions, with information about the general impact of the ADHD disorder on the family's daily life. Second, two special therapeutic conversations and support interviews will be offered to each family, where each parent can discuss their daily situation specifically and its impact on the family as a whole. Third, caregivers will have access to about 140 pages of evidence-based material on a closed website (pan pale) regarding the ADHD disorder in adolescents and its impact on the family.

The Unified Theory of Behavior Change (UTBC) has been proposed as a conceptual model to explain the mechanism underlying ADHD medication adherence and to guide the development of interventions to improve the continuity of treatment. The UTBC is a well-established and empirically tested model that identifies factors that influence an individual's intention to perform a behavior as well as factors that influence whether a behavior is actually carried out. Indeed, the research team's preliminary data support the relevance of pre-intention factors and implementation factors for medication continuity among adolescents with ADHD. Currently, no evidence-based interventions target medication continuity for adolescents with ADHD. The objective of this study is to test a multi-component intervention that systematically identifies and targets aspects of the UTBC model most relevant for each adolescent with poor ADHD medication continuity. The central hypothesis is that the tailored intervention will support ADHD medication continuity.

Participants who do not show significant symptom improvement on Concerta will then complete a 3-week trial of Adderall (mixed amphetamine salts), and the study will measure brain activity while those children are on the best dose of Adderall. The investigators will collect information from the child, caregivers, and teachers each week to measure ADHD symptom improvement and side effects. This study will therefore follow the typical treatment approach used in the Boston Children's Hospital Developmental Medicine Clinic, but the investigators will add measures of brain functioning before and after medication.",NO,ADHD,DRUG: Concerta|DRUG: Adderall-XR,Boston Children's Hospital,,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SEQUENTIAL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2023-02-17
NCT04173000,Tools to Improve Medication Continuity in Adolescents With ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04173000,COMPLETED,"Medication is an efficacious treatment strategy for adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), however use significantly declines during adolescence when the consequences of ADHD are most severe (e.g. dropping out of school, delinquency, etc.). The Unified Theory of Behavior Change (UTBC) has been proposed as a conceptual model to explain the mechanism underlying ADHD medication adherence and to guide the development of interventions to improve the continuity of treatment. The UTBC is a well-established and empirically tested model that identifies factors that influence an individual's intention to perform a behavior as well as factors that influence whether a behavior is actually carried out. Indeed, the research team's preliminary data support the relevance of pre-intention factors and implementation factors for medication continuity among adolescents with ADHD. Currently, no evidence-based interventions target medication continuity for adolescents with ADHD. The objective of this study is to test a multi-component intervention that systematically identifies and targets aspects of the UTBC model most relevant for each adolescent with poor ADHD medication continuity. The central hypothesis is that the tailored intervention will support ADHD medication continuity. The study will conduct an open label trial among adolescents with poor medication continuity to test whether the intervention engages the mechanism underlying medication continuity and improves outcomes.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,OTHER: Mehealth for ADHD software with medication continuity tools|OTHER: Mehealth for ADHD software without medication continuity tools,"Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati",,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,2019-07-02

The investigators hypothesized that amantadine would be beneficial for treatment of ADHD, and this could be evaluated in a double blind, randomized, parallel group comparison of amantadine and ritalin.

This will be a six-week, parallel group, randomized clinical trial undertaken in an outpatient child and adolescent clinic at Roozbeh Psychiatric Hospital in Tehran, Iran during April 2010-May 2010.

50 male and female subjects, ages 6 to 17 years with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of ADHD will be study population of this trial. At screening, investigators conduct a psychiatric evaluation with the DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD and the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime diagnostic interview and perform a complete medical history and physical examination.

The diagnosis of ADHD will be confirmed by a child and adolescent psychiatrist before participants will be initiated into the study. All patients will be newly diagnosed. Parents were carefully interview and ask to rate the severity of the DSM-IV-TR ADHD symptoms that their children display at home. Children will be excluded if they have a history or current diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders, schizophrenia or other psychiatric disorders(DSM-IV axis I); any current psychiatric comorbidity that required pharmacotherapy; any evidence of suicide risk and mental retardation (I.Q. \<70). In addition, patients will be excluded if they have a clinically significant chronic medical condition, including organic brain disorder, seizures and, current abuse or dependence on drugs within 6 months. Additional exclusion criteria will be hypertension, hypotension. To participate, parents and children have to be willing to comply with all requirements of the study. After a description of the procedures and purpose of the study, written informed consent will be obtained from each patient's parent or guardian. Informed consent will receive before the administration of any study procedure or dispensing of study medication in accordance with the ethical standards of the investigative site's institutional review board and with the Helsinki declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. The protocol will be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

Patients will be randomized to receive amantadine or ritalin in a 1: 1 ratio using a computer-generated code.

All study subjects will be randomly assigned to receive treatment using amantadine 100-150 mg depending on weight (100 mg/day for \<30 Kg and 150 mg/day for \>30 Kg) or ritalin at a dose of 20-30 mg/day depending on weight (20 mg/day for \<30 Kg and 30 mg/day for \>30 Kg) (group 2) for a 6 week double blind, randomized clinical.

The principal measure of outcome will be the Parent and Teacher ADHD Rating Scale-IV that has been used extensively in Iran in school-age children and provides valid measures of behavioral abnormality and attention trial.

Side effects will be systematically recorded throughout the study and will be assessed using a checklist that comprises 20 side effects including psychic, neurologic, autonomic and other side effects, administered by a child psychiatrist on days 7, 21and 42.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,DRUG: Amantadine|DRUG: ritalin,Tehran University of Medical Sciences,,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",2010-04

NCT04832737,Strength-based Treatment Approach for Adults With ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04832737,COMPLETED,"The aim of the research is to develop a treatment program with positive self-awareness and self-determination outcomes for adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Current treatments are based in a characterisation of ADHD oriented on deficits impairing everyday functioning, with primary goals of symptom control and reduction. However, treatment approaches are not standardised and only evidence short-term effectiveness. This project proposes an alternative approach to understanding ADHD behaviours, supported by Self Determination Theory (SDT). Research shows SDT based treatment approaches can support engagement of intrinsic motivation and longterm integration of behavioural change. ADHD research shows individuals are impaired in some contexts but not in others and can manage well, indicating potential for ADHD neurodiverse ""strengths"" which could be developed and supported. Recent psychology research recommends cultivating positive psychological factors and emotions to improve mental health and wellbeing. Adults aged 18+ with a confirmed ADHD diagnosis will be invited to participate in two projects: Intensive online interviews of 1 hour will be conducted to identify, explore, and construct a theory about the factors, or ""natural strengths"" in lived experience of ADHD that help individuals to overcome everyday impairments.

NCT02323633,"Phase IIa Exploratory Clinical Trial, to Examine the Safety and Efficacy of tPCS on Paediatric ADHD Participants",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02323633,UNKNOWN,"Children with ADHD display a certain brainwave profile which might be different to that of a child who does not have ADHD. Treatment with tPCS (transcranial pulsed current stimulation) has shown that this brainwave profile could possibly be altered to more closely resemble a brainwave profile of a child who does not have ADHD. Researchers believe that by changing this brainwave profile it might lessen symptoms of ADHD.

tPCS is a name used to describe the type of current this device produces. It involves randomly (in no specific pattern) produced pulses of current at different times that the brain picks up. These pulses of low current stimulate the brain in a certain way and affect the brainwave activity.

Treatment is given by applying a low frequency current using small electrodes clipped to the earlobes. The current comes from an external battery source. The pulses of current generated by this device stimulate certain parts of the brain which result in a possible increased control of attention and behaviour. This treatment has already been proven to be safe and will not hurt your child.

Due to these specific parts of the brain being stimulated, and the positive results of previous research, it seems possible to control certain functions in children suffering from inattention and hyperactivity.

The idea of using tPCS stimulation as a possible way for helping children with confirmed ADHD opens a new window to future research.

NLP is often used as a form of psychotherapy, coaching, or personal development, although its effectiveness has been debated in the scientific community.

NLP practitioners believe that our thoughts, emotions, and behavior are influenced by our internal representations of the world, which are constructed through language and sensory experiences. Changing the use of language and the perception of experiences, thoughts, emotions, and behavior can be adjusted accordingly. NLP uses various techniques to achieve this, including reframing, anchoring, and rapport-building. Reframing involves changing the perception of a situation by putting it in a different context or perspective. Anchoring consists in associating a particular state of mind or emotion with a specific physical or sensory stimulus, such as a touch or a smell. Rapport-building involves establishing a connection and a sense of trust with another person through mirroring and matching their body language, tone of voice, and language patterns.",NO,Academic Skill Disorder|Child Behavior,BEHAVIORAL: Neuro-linguistic program,Lebanese University,,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE",2023-03-20

A continuum of clinical presentations attributed to the effects of HIV-1 infection on the CNS, ranging from apparently normal development, decreases in the rate of new learning to the loss of acquired skills have been observed. Two domains of psychological functioning appear most susceptible to the effects of HIV infection on the central nervous system in children: expressive behavior and attentional processes (Brouwers, et al, 1994).

Attention deficits have been documented as a relative weakness on the ""freedom from distractibility"" subclass of IQ tests (Brouwers et al, 1989) and on behavior assessment (Moss et al, 1994). Attention, however, has many subcomponents such as focused attention, divided attention, vigilance, etc. Direct assessment of attentional functioning using reaction time has not yet been conducted and questions whether attentional components are differentially affected by the virus have not been addressed.

The proposed study would assess different components of attentional functioning in children with HIV-1 disease. A quantitative and systematic method is developed that could complement the existing standardized instruments used for measuring attention and neurocognitive function in this population. Simple alerted visual reaction time will be measured with varying preparatory intervals, a two-choice reaction time in a go/no-go paradigm will be administered, and a continuous performance, divided reaction time test and an object decision task will be given.

Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare reported the clibing suicide rate of youth in past five years and showed the prevention work and related intervention for youth's mental health was noteable. The definition of emotion regulation was ""consists of the extrinsic and intrinsic processes responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and modifying emotional reactions, especially their intensive and temporal features, to accomplish one's goals."" Emotion regulation strategies including ""rumination"", ""avoidance"", ""suppression"", ""Problem-solving"", ""reappraisal"", ""acceptance"", ""social support"", and ""distraction"".

Previous studies had examined the relationship between emotion regulation and mental health in youth; maladaptive emotion regulation would increase the individual's depressive and anxiety symptoms. Carstensen proposed social emotion theory in 1995 Selectivity theory (SST) refers to the need for emotion regulation, which activates Social participation in late adulthood. SST assumes that young people are more interested in social interaction behaviors related to information seeking and building self-concept. characteristics of youth affected by many normative challenges such as adolescence, school transitions, and more complex social Landscape; Adaptive emotion regulation will reduce risk of clinical emotion attacks of illness, especially depression and anxiety.To explore the relationship between emotion regulation and mental health from a psychosocial developmental aspect, we focused on the interaction between individual and environment.

ADHD: current treatment - International clinical guidelines indicate that pharmacological interventions in particular stimulants are the first-line treatment for ADHD. However, about 30% of children affected by the disorder do not respond to medication alone, exhibit partial response or can not tolerate the adverse effects. In addition there is a group of parents who do not accept the use of medication for the treatment of ADHD in their children. In recent years cognitive training has received considerable attention as a treatment to ADHD. The evidence base for cognitive training programs are still forming with few randomized placebo-controlled studies. However, this approach seems to be effective either as a treatment for ADHD - and others cognitive disorders in childhood - or as a tool to enhance cognitive ability and school performance in children and adults. No previous study has evaluated this cognitive intervention in a clinical trial with placebo-controlled intervention and as an adjunctive treatment to medication.

- Some children and teenagers have conditions known as conduct disorders. They often have long-term chronic behavior problems, such as defiant behavior or violence. Conduct disorders are often treated with antipsychotic medication. Researchers want to study two types of newer antipsychotics (aripiprizole and risperidone) for children and adolescents with conduct disorders. They will look at how these drugs affect brain activity. To do so, they will give brain activity tests using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The tests will compare the results from healthy volunteer children and teens to those of others with behavior problems.

Objectives:

- To see how atypical antipsychotics affect brain activity of children and teenagers with conduct disorders.

Eligibility:

* Children and teenagers between 10 and 18 years of age who have a conduct disorder and are taking aripiprizole.
* Children and teenagers between 10 and 18 years of age who have a conduct disorder and are taking risperidone.
* Children and teenagers between 10 and 18 years of age who have a conduct disorder and are not taking an atypical antipsychotic.
* Healthy volunteers between 10 and 18 years of age.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Parents/guardians will be asked questions about their child s feelings, experiences, and behavior. Participants will also answer questions about their feelings and moods.
* This study will involve two visits. Each visit will involve MRI scanning.
* At the first visit, participants will have memory and thinking tests. The tests will involve making decisions or playing games. Some of these tests will use MRI scanning to look at brain activity.
* The second visit will be 3 to 5 months after the first visit. The tests from the first visit will be repeated.",NO,Conduct Disorder|fMRI,,National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),Boys Town Research Hospital,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2013-04-29

NCT03535805,"Transdiagnostic, Cognitive and Behavioral Intervention for in School-aged Children With Emotional and Behavioral Disturbances",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03535805,COMPLETED,"Background

Impairing emotional and behavioural problems are common in children and adolescents and mark a three-fold increased risk of mental disorder in young adulthood. Evidence-based psychological interventions are recommended for indicated prevention and first-line treatment, but access to treatment is often limited.

A new, modular cognitive and behavioural therapy program Mind My Mind (MMM) comprising evidence-based interventions for children with emotional and behavioral problems was designed to be delivered by educational psychologists in the Danish municipalities.

A feasibility RCT (NCT03448809), demonstrated that the study design was acceptable among children, parents, and therapists, and it provided data to estimate the sample size needed for the definitive RCT. The investigators test the hypothesis that the parent-reported impact of mental health problems will be significantly lower for children in the MMM group as compared with children in the TAU group after the 18-week intervention period (primary hypothesis), and after follow-up at week 26 (first secondary hypothesis).

Aim

To investigate the effects and cost-effectiveness of MMM compared with TAU for children and adolescents with impairing anxiety, depressive symptoms and/or behavioral problems. Both beneficial and harmful effects are evaluated.

Methods

The study compares the new modular MMM with TAU for children aged 6-16 years with anxiety, depressive symptoms or behavioral problems impacting on their daily and social life. The trial is conducted in four Danish municipalities in the period from September 2017 to April 2019. Participants are children with indicated needs.

The parents sign up the child for assessment in the Pedagogical Psychological Services in the Municipalities. The assessment includes web-based standardized questionnaires for child and parent: 1) the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), 2) Spence Children's Anxiety Scale, 3) Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, and 4) family, social and school functioning. The questionnaires are supplemented with a clinical psychopathological interview by a trained psychologist. The investigators exclude children with 1) low levels of problems and no indicated needs, or 2) high levels of problems and need of referral to the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

412 children will be included and randomized (1:1) to MMM versus TAU. MMM is supported by a central organization, who is responsible for the education and weekly supervision of the therapists, and the web-based data collection and feedback of data in real time to therapists and researchers. All outcomes are self-, parent- and teacher-reported scores on standardized questionnaires administered at baseline, week 18 and week 26. At entry, the child and the parents own description of the Top-problem is recorded and scored on a 10-point likert scale. The Top-problem and impact of problem is scored by parent and child every second week during the intervention period, and the progress is monitored by the therapists in the MMM group. Information on costs is gathered through administrative registers and questionnaires at baseline, week 18, and week 26.

Primary objectives and outcome measures

This primary outcome is measured with the parent-reported SDQ impact-scale. The minimum relevant difference in impact of mental health problems was set at 1.0 corresponding to a change from severe to moderate, or from moderate to little-or-no impact in one of five domains of child's life: distress, home-life, friendships, classroom learning and leisure activities.

Secondary objectives and outcomes measures

The key secondary hypotheses are that the children in the MMM group will show significantly lower levels of parent-reported anxiety, depressive symptoms, functional impairment, Top-problems and behavioural problems, and better school attendance and quality-of-life as compared with the children in the TAU group at week 18.

All other outcomes are explored at week 18 and 26, including the primary and secondary measures of potential harm: 1) youths with severe and increased levels of self-reported suicidality, hopelessness and/or negative self-evaluation, and 2) youths with poor quality of life in relation to family, free time and friends.

Statistical analyses

All analyses will be intention-to-treat with two-sided significance tests. The investigators will use mixed models with repeated measures for continuous outcomes and generalized linear mixed model for binary and non-normally distributed outcomes. For the key secondary outcomes, the investigators will use the strategy of hierarchical testing allowing us to preserve the level of significance, α=0.05, as long as the null hypotheses are rejected. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be calculated to analyze cost-effectiveness.

Perspectives

The results will guide policy makers in deciding whether to implement modular CBT-programs like the MMM.",NO,Anxiety|Anxiety Disorders|Depressive Symptoms|Depressive Disorders|Problem Behavior|Oppositional Defiant Disorder|Conduct Disorder|Other Behavioral and Emotional Disorders With Onset Usually Occurring in Childhood and Adolescence,BEHAVIORAL: Mind My Mind (MMM)|BEHAVIORAL: Treatment as Usual (TAU),"Mental Health Services in the Capital Region, Denmark","TrygFonden, Denmark|The Danish Mental Health Foundation|Defactum, Central Denmark Region",INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2017-09-07

The basics of the disorder: inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors that manifest in a variety of settings causing a dysfunction in everyday life. ADHD can be subdivided into three sub-types: predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive or combined type. Common co-morbidities of ADHD are disruptive disorders; Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) being the major one with about half of children with the combined sub-type ADHD and about a quarter of children with the predominantly inattentive also suffering from ODD. Conduct disorder is a co-morbidity for about a quarter of children with the combined sub-type ADHD. The co-occurrence of these disorders is thought to have a negative effect on the outcome of both of them.

Methylphenidate (MPH), short or long acting, is the mainstay of medical treatment for ADHD patients, it's efficacy proven in a variety of studies. It should be noted that MPH has also been proven to have a beneficial effect on children with disruptive behaviors. For children with disruptive disorders Risperidone is the mainstay of medical treatment, and has been proven in clinical trials.

To the best of their knowledge, a ""head to head"" study comparing these two drugs for the treatment of pediatric patients with ADHD and co-morbidity of disruptive disorders was never done before. The investigators aim is to examine the efficacy and tolerability of MPH vs. Risperidone in this population. In addition, the investigators will apply DSM5's cross cutting symptom measures scales is order to further define this unique subset of patients.

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) is a new diagnosis in the latest version of the diagnostic and statistical manual (DSM5).

The diagnosis is clinical with the input of several informants (child, family, teachers, ...). ADHD is a risk factor for academic difficulties, school dropout, social isolation, injury, oppositional behaviour. In school-age children and adolescents having moderate to high or persistent impairment despite psycho-educational support and environmental modification, the first-line treatment is methylphenidate. Group or individual cognitive behavioural therapy for parents and/or children and adolescents is recommended for co-occurring disorders and persistent impairment. In France, the initiation of methylphenidate requires an annual hospital prescription by a paediatrician or psychiatrist, and a regular medical supervision (weight, heart rate, blood pressure, ...). At least once a year, the indication of methyphenidate needs to be re-evaluated and confirmed at the hospital. In case of lack of efficiency and/or poor tolerance, therapeutic alternatives including non-psychostimulants should be considered.

A randomized controlled trial evaluated the dose of methylphenidate received over a period of 13 months. It was observed that the ""combined treatment"" group (methylphenidate + psychosocial treatments) received a lower average dose of methylphenidate than the ""methylphenidate alone"" group. These results are difficult to extrapolate to the general population, due to the study protocol (regular monitoring of ADHD symptoms with the aim of total remission).

Impulsivity is acting 'without thinking.' Compulsivity is being overly inflexible. People vary in how impulsive or compulsive they are. Extreme versions of these behaviors play a role in mental disorders. Researchers want to study changes in the brain to learn more about these behaviors. Differences in genes may also play a role.

Objective:

To learn about genetic and brain features that explain why levels of impulsivity and compulsivity vary across people.

Eligibility:

People ages 6-80

Design:

Participants will be screened with a medical history and medical record review.

Participants will talk about their mental and behavioral development. They may discuss topics like drug use and sexual activity. They will complete surveys about their compulsivity and impulsivity. Parents of child participants may also complete these surveys.

Participants may take memory, attention, and thinking tests. They may give blood or saliva samples for gene studies.

Participants may have a magnetic resonance imaging scan. It will take pictures of their brain. The scanner is shaped like a cylinder. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the scanner. A coil will be placed over their head. They will lie still, watch a movie, and play a game.

Background: Pediatric tuina has been used and explored by many researchers and clinicians as a topical complementary and alternative treatment for ADHD, which can compensate for some of the shortcomings of medications and behavioural therapies, such as the side effects of medications and the financial stress of long-term behavioural therapies. Pediatric tuina can also grasp the golden stage of young children and improve their symptoms in time on the basis of TCM pattern identification and holistic concepts. We once conducted a focus group interview on 15 parents to understand the effects of parent-administered pediatric tuina on ADHD symptoms, and all parents reported that parent-administered pediatric tuina significantly improved the child's sleep quality, eating habits, and parent-child relationship within a short period of time after receiving the intervention.

Objective: This study aims to assess the preliminary effects, feasibility, and safety of parent-administered pediatric tuina for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in school-aged children.

Methods: This project is a three-arm, parallel, open-label, pilot RCT. Sixty participants were randomized into three groups at a 1:1:1 ratio. Parents in the parent-administered tuina group (n = 20) will attend a face-to-face training program on pediatric tuina for ADHD and conduct this intervention on their children at home. Parents in the parent-child interaction group (n = 20) will attend face-to-face training about parent-child interactive exercises and carry them out with their children at home. Both interventions will be carried out every other day during a two-month intervention period, with each manipulation for at least 25-30 min. Participants in the waitlist group (n=20) will not receive both interventions during the intervention period. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, week 4, and week 8.

NCT02543359,A Statewide Trial to Compare Three Training Models for Implementing an Evidence-based Treatment (EBT),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02543359,COMPLETED,"Evidence-based treatments (EBTs) are available for treating Disruptive Behavior Disorders ( DBDs) including Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT). Despite EBTs' potential to help children and families, they have primarily remained in university settings. Recognized field leaders have expressed concern over the discrepancy between treatment research and clinical practice, and have indicated that EBT implementation is a priority. Little empirical evidence exists regarding how effective commonly used training models are in changing clinician behavior, achieving full implementation (e.g., increasing treatment fidelity, integrating into service settings), and supporting positive client outcomes. This novel application will evaluate the effectiveness of three training models (Learning Collaborative, Train-the-Trainer, and Web-Supported Self-Study) to implement a well-established EBT in real-world, community settings.

To accomplish this goal, the project will be guided by three specific aims:

1. to build knowledge about training outcomes,
2. to build knowledge about implementation outcomes, and
3. to understand the impact of training clinicians using LC, TTT, and SS models on key client outcomes.

Seventy-two of 243 possible (30%) licensed psychiatric clinics across Pennsylvania will be randomized to one of three training conditions:

1. Learning Collaborative (LC),
2. Train-the-Trainer (TTT), or
3. Web-Supported Self-Study (SS).

Data also will be collected on staff trained by clinicians in the TTT group given that the intention of a TTT model is for participants of that group to return to their organization and train others within the organization. The impact of training (clinician level) will be evaluated at 4 time-points coinciding with the training schedule: baseline, 6, 12, and 24-months. Immediately after training begins, parent-child dyads (client level) will be recruited from the caseloads of participating clinicians (N = 288). Client outcomes will be assessed at four timepoints (pre-treatment, 3, 6, and 12-months). Implementation outcomes (clinic level) will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12, and 24-months after training.

NCT02807870,Early Interventions in Children With Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02807870,COMPLETED,"Introduction: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent mental disorders in children and is associated with important negative functional outcomes throughout development. The first signs and symptoms become apparent in preschool age. Therefore, early interventions in this population have the potential of limiting the disorder's negative impact and preventing future impairments in affected individuals. The first-choice medication for treating ADHD is methylphenidate, which has evidence of efficacy and safety in preschool children. However, non-evidence based worries and pressure from the media placed parent training as the first-line treatment for ADHD in clinical guidelines. Parent training is a behavioral intervention implemented with the parents, with weekly sessions for 8 weeks, adequate for treating ADHD dysfunctional symptoms and behaviors. However, the level of evidence for this intervention is reduced. Furthermore, the need of trained therapists in the public health system, added to the difficulties on adherence and comprehension from parents, limit its generalization and raise questions regarding its indications. Until now, no study has compared pharmacological treatment with methylphenidate to parent training in preschool children with ADHD regarding their clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Moreover, no study has evaluated the impact of pharmacological intervention and psychotherapy on neurobiological mechanisms of ADHD, which is crucial for determining their impact on neurodevelopment.

Objectives: This is a double-blind randomized clinical trial that aims to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability of treatment with methylphenidate compared to parental training and placebo in preschool children with ADHD.

Methods: This study will be a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, evaluating two active interventions and placebo control group. One hundred and fifty children aged 3 years and 11 months and 5 years and 11 months, diagnosed with ADHD, will be randomized to receive treatment with methylphenidate and information (50 children), parental training and treatment with placebo medication (50 children) or belong to active control group with educational information for parents and placebo treatment with no treatment (active control, 50 children). The treatment will last eight weeks, the neurobiological outcomes will be assessed before and after treatment and clinical outcomes will be assessed at weeks 0, 5 and 9. After the end of treatment, all participants will be invited to participate in a 3 years' annual follow-up. 50 children with typical development will also be evaluated in relation to neurobiological measures.

Implications: This study proposes an innovative and relevant analysis, which will enable the field to advance the knowledge of biological mechanisms related to ADHD and to treatment response.

Conduct disorders affect 5 to 9% of 15-year old boys.

Care management of children and adolescents admitted for disruptive behaviors in emergency rooms is an issue. No consensus or official recommendation exists. However, use of emergency care in this context is increasing in most western countries and it exposes to several risks (inappropriate use of hospitalizations, social rupture, ignorance of comorbidities and suicide risk). The Trajectories project is designed to describe children and adolescents with disruptive behaviors, their care management and to follow their life trajectory and psychiatric evolution after admission to emergency rooms. Better understanding this population will improve their medical and social care management, thereby giving professionals the right tools.

The main objective of this project is to implement a multidisciplinary and integrative research combining clinical considerations and social sciences to determine the ""trajectory"" of this population.",NO,Disruptive Behavior Disorder,OTHER: patients with conduct disorders,Hospices Civils de Lyon,,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2019-05-20
NCT04627415,Project PEAK: Early Intervention for ADHD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04627415,RECRUITING,"Parent education is an effective and relatively cost efficient approach for reducing child behavior problems. Research, however, suggests that the effectiveness of parent education is mitigated by parent attendance and parent implementation of intervention strategies. That is, low attendance at parent education sessions is associated with limited intervention effects. Therefore, it is critical to identify strategies to enhance parent engagement. A previous pilot randomized controlled trial of a parent education program (Behavioral Parent Education; BPE, specifically Promoting Engagement for ADHD pre-Kindergartners \[PEAK\]), found that both face-to-face (F2F) and online BPE resulted in high levels of parent engagement and child behavior improvements. However, results need to be replicated in a full scale efficacy trial with a larger, diverse sample to provide more reliable estimates of relative effect sizes for parent and child outcomes and to evaluate the extent to which parent and child behavior changes are maintained after BPE has ended. In the current randomized controlled trial, the investigators intend to apply What Works Clearinghouse group design standards to examine the efficacy of two forms of delivery of BPE (F2F and online) relative to a wait-list control condition in a sample of 180, 3- to 5-year old children with clinically significant symptoms of ADHD. The objective is to: (a) extend findings from the pilot investigation to a large, diverse sample; (b) examine maintenance of effects; (c) identify moderators and mediators of treatment outcome, especially the degree to which these may differ for F2F vs. online treatment delivery; and (d) assess cost and cost-effectiveness of the two PEAK delivery formats.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|Parent-Child Relations|Child Behavior|Parenting,BEHAVIORAL: Promoting Engagement with ADHD Pre-Kindergarteners,Lehigh University,Institute of Education Sciences,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2020-09-01

Indicated drug treatments for ADHD fall into 2 categories: stimulants (such as methylphenidate and amphetamines) and non-stimulants (such as atomoxetine, guanfacine and clonidine) but some persons cannot tolerate their secondary effects or find them non-effective.

In the last decade, medical cannabis products have been researched as possible treatment for neurological and mental diseases such as: Post trauma disorder (PTD), autism (ASD), epilepsy, fibromyalgia (FM) and more.

Data on the effects of cannabidiol rich cannabis extract use for ADHD seems promising but is still limited. The aim of this study is to investigate if oral cannabinoids given to adults with ADHD affect the symptoms of the disorder.

Although medication and behavioral therapy, have been shown to be effective for reducing core symptoms, about 30% of patients with ADHD would not achieve the treatment response and symptomatic remission. Additionally, some children can experience sides effects related to medication. Therefore, other psychological approaches such as Mindfulness based interventions (MBIs) have been designed for the management of ADHD.

Recent research showed that ADHD is associated with autonomic nervous system dysregulation, characterized by reduced vagally mediated-HRV, in response to a task demand. HRV is an accurate, non-invasive, cost-effective quantitative biomarker of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. There is evidence that MBIs could significantly reduce ADHD core symptoms and may enhance HRV through increased parasympathetic modulation.

NCT03279952,Neurophysiological Markers of Pediatric Irritability and Its Response to Intervention,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03279952,RECRUITING,"There has been an increasing focus on the adverse impacts of irritability, defined as increased tendency towards anger. Irritability worsens peer relationships, family functioning, academic performance and is a risk factor for depression, suicide and substance use and is one of the main reasons why children get referred for treatment. It has been identified as transdiagnostic entity meriting investigation as a treatment target for personalized intervention given its prevalence and morbidity. Most children with prominent irritability also meet criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) but only a subset of children with ADHD manifest impairing levels of irritability. Irritability levels are only minimally correlated with severity of ADHD symptoms suggesting that irritability is not simply a manifestation of severe ADHD. The first line treatment for irritability in children with ADHD is to optimize the dose of the CNS stimulant. However, there is great heterogeneity in response, with baseline mood lability being the best marker for both improving and worsening irritability. In addition, increased irritability is one of the most common reasons why parents stop these medications. The unpredictability in response to CNS stimulants has led to the increasing use of antipsychotics and other non-evidence based treatments for ADHD. It is unknown what drives this heterogeneity in response in part because little is known about the underlying causal mechanisms for irritability in youth with ADHD. Two areas theorized to contribute to irritability include impairments in learning from experience (instrumental learning) and sensitivity to reward and loss.1 There are objective methods for measuring these domains in children through the use of even-related potentials (ERPs)- synchronous neural activity in response to a stimulus. Reward positivity (RewP) is an ERP component occurring in response to feedback on task performance that can be broken down to separate reward and loss components. Irritability is thought to arise due to the combination of an enhanced drive for reward coupled with an excessive response to loss. No prior work has examined associations of RewP with irritability in ADHD. However, abnormalities in RewP and elevated irritability have both been established as risk factors for depression, suggesting that RewP may also predict irritability. Error related negativity (ERN) reflects the preconscious detection of potential conflict serving as an early warning signal for errors. Error detection is one of the first steps for instrumental learning. It is impaired in some youth with ADHD, with a suppressed ERN correlated with reduced error processing. CNS stimulants improve ERN amplitude and impaired error processing. We theorize that abnormalities in RewP and ERN in children with ADHD will serve as respective markers for severity of irritability and subsequent treatment response to CNS stimulants. If successful, we will have identified a causal pathway for irritability that will aide treatment development and identified a reliable biomarker for the current first line treatment for irritability in ADHD (CNS Stimulants), while providing care to a significantly impaired group of local children for whom few evidence-based treatments exist.",NO,ADHD,DRUG: CNS Stimulant,Milton S.

NCT04779632,Fish Oil Affects Cognition and ADHD Symptoms in Adults With Autism Spectrum Disorder,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04779632,COMPLETED,"The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is rising and was estimated to have a prevalence of around 1.5% in developed countries in 2016. ASD is characterized by impairments in social interaction and repetitive behavior and is associated with executive dysfunction such as impaired working memory, inhibition, and flexibility. Furthermore, ASD is often associated with multiple comorbidities such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and anxiety.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate that fish oil (FO) supplementation improves attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity in children with ADHD and beneficial effects in adults with depression and anxiety. Some randomized trials in children with ASD have shown improvements on selected executive functions, but results from meta-analysis are inconsistent and no trial has examined the effect in adults with ASD. Furthermore, most of the previous studies have mainly assessed effects by questionnaires and no objective tests, only provided low doses (\<1.5 g/d of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids) and none of them have examined the potential influence of comorbid ADHD, depression, or anxiety.

The aim of the study was to examine the effect of FO on sustained attention and visuospatial short-term memory memory, as well as cognitive inhibition, executive function, and core symptoms of ASD, and of ADHD, and social function in adults with ASD. In light of the shared and additive cognitive impairments in individuals with both ASD and ADHD, the hypothesis was that individuals with comorbid ADHD will show the most pronounced effects.

EF is a collection of cognitive control processes that includes working memory (i.e., maintain/manipulate data not perceptually present), inhibition (i.e., inhibit/control of attention, thoughts, behaviors) and flexibility (i.e., shift flexibly between tasks/sets). These EF subdomains are subserved by a network (i.e., cognitive control network) of frontal (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex \[DLPFC\]), parietal and subcortical regions, with hypoactivation in such regions often underlying EF deficits. There is a recent call in psychiatry to develop experimental therapeutics that target anomalous neural systems underlying symptomology. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a therapeutic, non-invasive method of cortical excitability modulation. High frequency rTMS to the left DPLFC has an activating effect on the cognitive control network, with initial research in adults finding a subsequent enhancing effect on working memory, inhibition, and flexibility. rTMS represents a very promising potential tool to target EF deficits in psychopathology.",NO,ADHD With Working Memory Deficits,"DEVICE: Magstim Super Rapid2 stimulator, 10 Hz condition|DEVICE: Magstim Super Rapid2 stimulator, Sham condition|DEVICE: Magstim Super Rapid2 stimulator, iTBS condition",Bradley Hospital,Thrasher Research Fund|Rhode Island Foundation,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2019-11-01

NCT00001915,Study of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00001915,COMPLETED,"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a condition characterized by a decreased attention span, hyperactivity, and/or impulsiveness inappropriate for a certain age.

Typically, young children have what are known as subtle neurological signs. These are involuntary movements of one part of the body that occur while the child is making a voluntary movement of another part of the body. This is referred to as synkinesis, or overflow movements. These overflow movements disappear during normal development and are usually gone by the age of 10. However, in children with ADHD these overflow movements tend to be more intense and last long after the age of 10. This leads researchers to believe there is an abnormality in the maturation and development of the brain areas associated with motor activity in children with ADHD.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique that gives information about brain function. It is very useful when studying areas of the nervous system related to motor activity (motor cortex, corticospinal tract, and corpus callosum). A magnetic signal given from a special instrument held close to the patient's head stimulates a small area of the brain that controls a few muscles (for example, the muscles that control one finger). Doctors put electrodes (small pieces of metal taped to areas of the body) over the muscle to measure the electrical activity the muscle produces when it makes a movement. When the magnetic signal activates those muscles the electrodes pick up and record the electrical activity of the movement that the muscles make in response to the magnetic signal.

Researchers will study normal children and those diagnosed with ADHD using TMS to find out if the clinical abnormalities of ADHD are associated with a delay or abnormality in maturation of areas of the nervous system responsible for motor activity (motor cortex and corticospinal tract).",NO,Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity,,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,1999-01

NCT04298437,Addressing Depression and Positive Parenting Techniques (ADAPT),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04298437,RECRUITING,"Children with emotional and behavioural difficulties (EBD) experience disproportionate social, family and academic impairment and have between two to five times increased likelihood of developing an anxiety disorder, mood disorder or other severe mental illness in adolescence and adulthood. There is a close association between parental depression and the emergence and maintenance of childhood EBD that is likely bidirectional. Parents of children with EBD experience disproportionate stress, increasing their risk for depression; yet chronic and untreated parental depression is associated with the emergence of child EBD in the first place. Therefore, designing targeted and effective assessment and treatment for parents of children with EBD that take into account parents' depression is necessary. Of pressing concern, first-line Behavioral Parent Training (BPT) treatments for parents of children with EBD are not tailored to parent's mental health needs, which may be why upwards of 40 percent of parents and children treated in these programs fail to sufficiently benefit. Existing research highlights emotional and cognitive factors that may differentiate depressed parents from non-depressed parents that may be treatment targets to improve outcomes for depressed parents and children.

The main aim of the proposed project is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a novel targeted treatment for depressed parents of children with EBD, along with adherence to study protocol. The investigators will use the results of the pilot study to make key modifications to study procedures and the treatment itself to increase the success of a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test treatment efficacy.

1. to validate the executive functions, visuospatial memory, and structural and functional connectivity in frontostriatal, and frontoparietal circuitries as effective neurocognitive endophenotypes;
2. to correlate the data from structural and functional connectivity, neuropsychology, and ADHD core symptoms stratifying by the presence of ADHD, proband-unaffected sibling dyads, and the presence of DAT1 variant; and
3. To investigate reported candidate genes, in addition to DAT1 variant, related to dopamine and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems in the association with neurocognitive endophenotypes such as DRD1, DRD2, DRD4, DRD5, DBH, MAO-A, ADRA2A, ADRA2C, NET, and COMT.",NO,Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,,National Taiwan University Hospital,,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2012-08-01

Subjects: Participants are 40 consecutive patients remitted to a neuropsychiatric investigation at the Dependence Clinic Västmanland, Västerås, Sweden.

Method: The study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. The study is taken place during four hours on two investigating days, separated by a 4 days wash-out period.

All patients participate on two occasions: In one session they receive the Methylphenidate (MPH) condition, and in the other session they receive the placebo condition. MPH and placebo conditions are counterbalanced across subjects such that half of the participants receive MPH first, and the other half of the participants receive placebo first. Neither the participant nor the research assistant is aware when the participant receive the MPH condition or the placebo condition.

On each investigating day the participant accomplish Questionnaires (Visual Analogical Scales) concerning; (a) expectation, (b) self-rated performance, (c) exhausting exercise, (d) perceived help from the pill and (e) self-rated symptoms. In addition the participant completed A Quick Test of Cognitive Speed (AQT) and two separate Quantified Behavior Test Plus (QbTest) without medication vs MPH/Placebo. QbTest aims to provide objective information regarding core-symptoms of ADHD; hyperactivity on the basis of motor-activity measured with the camera, and inattention and impulsivity on basis of the CPT-test.

The Quantized Behavior Test (QbTest) can be included as part of an neuropsychiatric investigation. QbTest measures the three core signs of ADHD, hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity. QbTest is a computer-based test that combines a test of attention ability with a movement analysis based on an infrared measurement system.

It is of great interest to identify biomarkers relating to medication response in ADHD. However, the procedure for obtaining central markers such as PET scan is invasive and expensive. Previous studies have found that mRNA expression of neurochemical markers in circulating blood can reflect the neurochemical levels in the brain.

Twin and adoption studies indicate that additive genetic factors explain up to 80% of the variance underlying susceptibility.

As full siblings share on average 50% of their genes, even the unaffected siblings of children with ADHD would be expected to share some of the genes involved in the disorder. The neuroanatomical substrate of ADHD is becoming increasingly better defined by a growing body of evidence from imaging studies. Evidence from neuroimaging studies suggests that this disorder is associated with reductions in brain volume up to 5% in these children.

Thus, there are potential public health benefits for novel behavioral training programs that could remediate the core features of ADHD and contribute to sustained improvements in behavioral control.

Based on this information, the CNIR initiated a feasibility trial of a movement-based intervention, utilizing Tai Chi practice, targeting improved behavioral control through engagement of the motor system and results are highly promising. The investigators therefore will employ an extension of our ongoing Tai Chi programs for children with ADHD, beginning with children who have already completed one of the previous Tai Chi sessions.

This project builds on 15 years of programmatic research underlying the development of the Family Check-up model (FCU), originally referred to as the Adolescent Transitions Program (ATP; Dishion \& Kavanagh, 2003), but later expanded as a general approach to mental health treatment for children from ages 2 through 17 (Dishion \& Stormshak, 2007). The FCU model is a multilevel, family-centered strategy delivered within the context of a public school setting that comprehensively links universal, selected, and indicated family interventions. Previous research and the investigators' practical experience working in school settings indicate that the intervention strategy needs improvement in 3 critical areas to build on previous significant effects and to enhance the potential for future dissemination and large-scale implementation:(a) improve the feasibility of both the universal level and the indicated level of the intervention by broadening the intervention components and systematically embedding these components into the current behavioral support systems in the schools; (b) address the transition from middle school to high school, with special attention to academic engagement and reduction of deviant peer clustering; and (c) explicitly incorporate principals of successful interventions with families and young adolescents of diverse ethnic groups into both the universal and indicated models. An additional general goal of this study is to develop, test, and refine a set of research-based instruments that facilitate evaluation, training, implementation, and monitoring of intervention fidelity to maximize the potential success of implementation and large-scale dissemination.

Continuation Aim 1 is to track the persistence of intervention-related effects as the MTA sample matures into mid-adolescence, including subsequent mental-health and school-related service utilization patterns as a function of MTA treatment experience (treatment assignment) and outcome (degree of treatment success at 14 mo.). Aim 2 is to test specific hypotheses about predictors, mediators, and moderators of long-term outcome among children with ADHD (e.g., comorbidity; family functioning; cognitive skills; peer relations) that may influence adolescent functioning (either independent of or through initial treatment assignment and/or 14-month treatment outcomes); and to compare how these predictors, mediators, and moderators are similar or dissimilar within the normal comparison group. Aim 3 is to track the patterns of risk and protective factors (including their mediation or moderation by initial treatment assignment and/or outcome) involved in early and subsequent stages of developing substance-related disorders and antisocial behavior. Aim 4 is to examine the effect of initial treatment assignment and degree of treatment success on later academic performance, achievement, school conduct, tendency to drop out, and other adverse school outcomes.

In the original MTA design, patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment conditions: (1) medication only; (2) psychosocial only; (3) combined (medication and psychosocial); or (4) Assessment-and-Referral condition. All but the latter were treated intensively for 14 months, with assessments for all subjects at baseline, 3, 9, 14, and 24 months. The original MTA design thus provides short-term (10 months post-treatment) follow-up at 24 months. This continuation extends the follow-up to assessments at 36, 60, and 84 months after treatment.

If this happens, people may not be aware of anything on one side, usually the same side they also lost their movement (the most affected side). This severe condition is called spatial neglect. Currently there is no recommended diagnostic test or clinically-proven treatment for the condition. In a recent study, the investigators found a long-lasting reduction in neglect if people practiced picking-up an object with their unaffected hand. This intervention is called Spatial Inattention Grasping Home-based Therapy (SIGHT). It requires people to lift wooden rods of different lengths. Once a person is familiar with the task, they can practice on their own at a time convenient to them in their homes. The investigators have developed the first computerized version of SIGHT (c-SIGHT) as well as a novel diagnostic test for neglect using portable low-cost motion-tracking technology that can be used in the patient's home. In the proposed study, the investigators will investigate how usable and acceptable this technology is in people's homes. Stroke survivors (recruited from community settings) will undergo a 7-day self-led training at their homes with c-SIGHT. At the end of the intervention, 1:1 semi-structured interviews will be carried out with both stroke survivors and carers to investigate usability and acceptability of c-SIGHT.

The diagnosis of ADHD is mainly based on clinical interview of parents and children with assistance of teachers' reports. Self-administered rating scales are useful for screening, assistance of diagnosis, and measurement of symptom changes over time or due to treatment effect. The goals of this study are to establish the norms and psychometric properties of the Chinese version of teacher and parent forms of the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham, version IV (SNAP-IV) and the teacher, parent, and student forms of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for future studies on ADHD in Taiwanese populations.

Subjects and Methods: This is a cross-sectional, school-based survey with a multi-stage sampling method. The participants include a school-based sample of 3534 first to eighth graders was recruited from four areas: Taipei City, Taoyuan County, Tainan City and Chiayi County. Among them, 200students will be reassessed at 2-week interval for the test-retest reliability study. The instruments comprise the Chinese version of Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL), SDQ, SNAP-IV, and Adult ADHD Rating Scale. The informants include student participants older than 10 years old, their parents, and teachers. The main statistical methods include Pearson correlation, intraclass correlation, Chronbach's α for internal consistency, and mixed model to address lack of independence within the same classes and schools.

Anticipated Goals: We expect that this study will reach the following objectives:

1. to obtain the primitive information about the prevalence of ADHD symptoms and emotional/behavioral problems among children and adolescents in Taipei and Yun-Ling;
2. to enhance the awareness of school teachers and counselors about ADHD and other behavioral/emotional problems among students;

This may happen because children often have negative reputations with their classmates that are hard to change. That is, once a class of children get the impression that one child is disliked or the social outcast, even if that child's ADHD symptoms get better, the peer group may not notice any of these improvements. It is hypothesized that the elementary school teacher may be able to help peers notice positive behavior changes in children with ADHD when they do occur. This clinical trial will design and pilot-test an intervention that would train teachers in classroom practices to reduce the peer rejection of students with ADHD. The pilot test will be conducted in a summer program created to be similar to a regular school classroom in structure. If the treatment seems to succeed in the summer program, then it will be tried in regular classrooms in a future study.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,BEHAVIORAL: Behavioral contingency management|BEHAVIORAL: Tolerance training,University of Virginia,,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2011-01

NCT02919215,Teacher Help for Children and Youth With Mental Health Disorders,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02919215,UNKNOWN,"Teachers are increasingly faced with classrooms of students whose needs require support far beyond what traditional teacher-training programs prepare educators to provide. The presence of students with greater challenges in classrooms is due in part to the move to a full inclusion model of education and also to the rising epidemic of mental health disorders in youth. Mental health problems affect up to one million Canadian youth and their families. However, few of these individuals (\~20%) receive the support they need (Kirby, 2013; Kutcher \& McLuckie, 2013). The Teacher Help research team along with industry partner, Velsoft, and key knowledge user, Nova Scotia Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, will address this barrier by developing, evaluating, and commercializing a sustainable eHealth resource for teachers. Teacher Help is an online program that assists teachers in providing evidence-based interventions to students in grades 1-12 with mental health disorders in the classroom. The program allows teachers in a typical classroom setting to access information and expert-coach and peer support when they need it, so they can intervene early in order to reduce the negative consequences of mental health disorders in youth. Currently three modules (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder \[ADHD\], Autism Spectrum Disorder \[ASD\], and Learning Disabilities \[LD\]) are at different stages in the innovation pipeline. The investigators will test whether teachers make good use of this program and whether it is effective in improving mental health outcomes among children and youth both at school and at home. The investigators will also study whether the program changes teacher's attitudes toward children and youth with these disorders. The investigators will provide information to the Department of Education on how to use this program. This approach will help ensure that the program will continue after the research study ends. To the Teacher Help team's knowledge Teacher Help is the first and only research-validated eHealth program directly targeting teachers to help them intervene with children and youth who have mental health disorders, thus allowing Canada to take a lead in eHealth as applied to a school context.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|Autism Spectrum Disorder|Learning Disabilities,BEHAVIORAL: Teacher Help Intervention,IWK Health Centre,,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2017-01
NCT03533556,Effects of L-theanine and Caffeine on Attention and Attention-related Brain Activity of Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03533556,COMPLETED,"L-theanine and caffeine are two natural constituents of tea. Both of these compounds are among the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's list of Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) substances. Results of several clinical trials the PI and his team has conducted are consistent with results of many others to indicate that oral intake of each of 2.5 mg/kg body weight of L-theanine and 2.0 mg/kg body weight of caffeine is associated with improved attention in adults. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that, when taken in combination, L-theanine and caffeine seem to have additive effects in improving attention in adults. However, the specific actions of these substances have not been examined in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), who are characterized by impaired attention, hyperkinesia and impulsivity.

Therefore, the investigators plan to study the functional activity of brains (both at rest and when performing standard tasks designed to measure attention) in children diagnosed with ADHD using functional magnetic resonance imaging, after they consume either 2.5 mg/kg of L-theanine, 2.0 mg/kg of caffeine and their combination as compared to a placebo (water). Based on our previous findings, the investigators expect to observe improvements (speed of responding and accuracy) in standard tests of attention with intake of L-theanine, caffeine and their combination as compared to the placebo. The investigators also expect to observe decreased functional activity in brain regions that typically show increased activity during mind wandering with intake of L-theanine, caffeine and their combination.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: L-theanine|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Caffeine|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: L-theanine-Caffeine Combination|OTHER: Placebo,Texas Tech University,Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2018-05-14

The Vanderbilt is a previously developed, freely available set of parent- and teacher-report questionnaires designed to identify ADHD and related disorders in children. The Vanderbilt measures have been chosen for inclusion in the new computerized Integrated Clinical Information Sharing System (ICISS) being rolled out in five Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) departments/divisions (Adolescent/Young Adult Practice, Children's Hospital Primary Care Center, Developmental Medicine Center, Department of Neurology, Department of Psychiatry). The Vanderbilt was developed and validated for use among children up to age 12 years (Wolraich et al., 2003; Wolraich et al., 2013; Bard et al., 2013), and little is known about its appropriateness for use among older youth. In addition, there is no self-report version of the Vanderbilt that can be administered directly to adolescents and young adults (ages 13-21 years), for whom parents and teachers are often less knowledgeable reporters. To address these shortcomings, a multidisciplinary team of BCH adolescent health clinicians and researchers modified the parent and teacher Vanderbilt questionnaires to make them age-appropriate for adolescents and young adults and created a complementary self-report version for adolescents and young adults. The goal of the current study is to 1) assess the feasibility and acceptability of online administration through the ICISS system of the new parent, teacher, and youth self-report Vanderbilt measures among adolescent and young adult BCH patients aged 13-21 years; 2) test their reliability in terms of internal consistency reliability, temporal stability of responses over a one-month test-retest, and inter-rater agreement across all informants (parents, teachers, and youths); and 3) test their validity by evaluating their convergence with a similar set of ADHD screening tools, the Conners scales, already validated for use with adolescents and young adults.",NO,ADHD,,Boston Children's Hospital,,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2014-05

NCT01750307,The Relationship of Essential Fatty Acids to Adult ADHD: The OCEAN Study (Oils and Cognitive Effects in Adult ADHD Neurodevelopment),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01750307,UNKNOWN,"Brief summary

The aim of the study is to provide preliminary data on the relationship of Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs) to cognitive and electrophysiological measures of brain and behavioural functions in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and controls. This main aim will be achieved in two ways. First the investigators will measure the relationship of the various measures to blood levels of EFAs in ADHD cases and controls. Secondly, the potential effects of dietary supplementation with EFAs on cognitive-electrophysiological and behavioural measures in ADHD cases will be investigated. We will evaluate the extent to which changes in neuronal activity and cognitive performance are related to behavioural and functional measures over time. This is to be carried out by conducting a randomised controlled trial of fish oil supplementation in adults with ADHD (The OCEAN study: Oils and Cognitive Effects in Adult Neurodevelopment).

The study design will be a 6-month double blind placebo control study with a group of 80 adults with a diagnosis of ADHD. The group will be divided into 40 participants who receive EFA dietary supplements and 40 who receive placebo, over a 6-month period. Allocation to EFA dietary supplementation and placebo groups will be randomly allocated and blind to both the investigator and participants. In addition a sample of 30 controls will take part in baseline levels of assessment and be used for case-control comparisons to investigate the links between EFA blood levels and cognitive-electrophysiological function at one time point.

The study design will enable preliminary data to address the following hypotheses:

1. Changes in cognitive and electrophysiological function (neuronal activity) will be found following supplementation with dietary EFAs.
2. Changes in cognition and/or brain activity will be related to blood levels of EFAs.
3. Changes in cognitive performance and electrophysiological parameters will correlate with behavioural function, affective regulation or functional impairments.
4.

The most prominent symptoms in adults are inattention, emotional instability, disorganized behavior, impulsivity and restlessness, which cause several restrictions in different areas of life. It is suggested that those symptoms can be attributed to a general deficit in inhibitory control. This hypothesis is supported by several studies revealing that patients with ADHD show poor performance completing inhibitory control tasks.

Furthermore, studies showed that a unique administration of atomoxetin (ATX) significantly improves inhibitory control in patients with ADHD as well as in healthy participtants. In contrast to other medication authorized for the treatment of patients with ADHD, does ATX has no risk for potential addiction. Due its indirect mode of action, ATX has a delayed effect occurence taking up to 2 weeks. However, this apects was unconsidered in those studies.

Children's ADHD symptoms were also examined.

Methods: A randomized control trial was conducted between July 2017 and April 2018. Primary caregivers aged 20 to 65 years who had ADHD children aged 7 to 12 years were recruited from a psychiatric outpatient department. Sixty caregivers were randomized to the health promotion group intervention (n=30) and the control groups (n=30). The control group received usual care. Study instruments included the Swanson, Nolan, Pelham, Version IV (SNAP-IV), Parenting Stress Scale (Short form), Taiwan's Concise World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), and Health-Promotion Lifestyle Profile.

Both groups were evaluated before and immediately after the intervention at 1, 3, and 6 months. GEE was applied for statistical analysis.

Results: 60 participants were randomized to the health promotion intervention (n=30) or the control group (n=30). To explore the effect of health promotion programs on parental stress, quality of life, and health-promoting lifestyles for primary caregivers who are caring for children with ADHD.

Conclusion: We hope that the Health promotion program could demonstrate the effect in reducing parental stress, improving the quality of life, promoting healthy lifestyles for primary caregivers, and reducing the symptoms of children with ADHD.

NCT04091633,School Health Implementation Network: Eastern Mediterranean,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04091633,COMPLETED,"Background

An estimated 10-20% of children globally are affected by a mental health problem. Child mental health has been identified as a priority issue by the World Health Organization's Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (WHO EMRO). Following consultations with international and regional experts and stakeholders, WHO EMRO developed an evidence-based School Mental Health Program (SMHP), endorsed by WHO EMRO member countries, including Pakistan. The federal and provincial health departments in Pakistan made recommendations for a phased implementation of the SMHP in a pilot district. In the formative phase of this program, a number of implementation challenges were identified by the stakeholders. Broadly, these included the need to operationalize and adapt the existing components of the intervention to the local context and to develop sustainable mechanisms for delivery of quality training and supervision.

Informed by the results of a formative phase investigations, the SHINE scale-up research team adapted the SMHP (henceforth called Conventional SMHP or cSMHP) to address these implementation challenges. The enhanced version of the intervention is called Enhanced School Mental Health Program (eSMHP). Enhancements to cSMHP have occurred at two levels: A) Content enhancements, such as a collaborative care model for engaging parents/primary caregivers, strategies for teacher's wellbeing, and adaptation and operationalization of particular clinical intervention strategies and B) Technological enhancements which include adaptation of the training manual for delivery using an online training platform, and a 'Chat-bot' to aid the implementation of intervention strategies in classroom settings.

Objectives

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of eSMHP in reducing socio-emotional difficulties in school-going children, aged 8-13, compared to cSMHP in Gujar Khan, a rural sub-district of Rawalpindi, Pakistan.

The secondary objectives are to compare the cost-effectiveness, acceptability, adoption, appropriateness (including cultural appropriateness), feasibility, penetration and sustainability of scaled-up implementation of eSMHP and cSMHP. It is hypothesized that eSMHP will prove to be both more effective and more scalable than cSMHP.

Study population

The research is embedded within the phased district level implementation of the cSMHP in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The study population will consist of children of both genders, aged 8-13 (n=960) with socio-emotional difficulties, studying in rural public schools of sub-district Gujar Khan in Rawalpindi.

Design

The proposed study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT), embedded within the conventional implementation of the SMHP. Following relevant ethics committees and regulatory approvals, 80 eligible schools, stratified by gender, will be randomized into intervention and control arms with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Following informed consent from the parent/ primary caregiver, children will be screened for socio-emotional difficulties using Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). 960 children scoring \> 12 on the teacher-rated SDQ total difficulty scores and \> 14 on the parent-rated SDQ total difficulty scores will be recruited and equally randomized into intervention and control arms (480 in each arm).

Teachers in the intervention arm will receive training in eSMHP, whereas teachers in the active control will be trained in cSMHP. Trained teachers will deliver the program to children in their respective arms.

Outcome measures

Primary Outcome: The primary outcome is reduction in socio-emotional total difficulties scores, measured with the parent-rated SDQ, 9 months after commencing intervention delivery.

Secondary Outcomes: Implementation data on acceptability, adoption, appropriateness (including cultural appropriateness), feasibility, penetration and sustainability outcomes will be collected from children, parents/primary caregivers, head teachers and teachers. In addition, data will be collected on self-reported Psychological Outcome Profiles (PSYCHLOPS)-KIDS to measure progress on psycho-social problems and wellbeing; annual academic performance; classroom absenteeism, stigmatizing experiences and parent-teacher interaction. Data on teachers' sense of efficacy and subjective well-being, and on the schools' psychosocial environment profile will be collected. All secondary outcome data will be collected at baseline and 9 months after commencing intervention delivery.

Outcomes will be analyzed on an intention to treat basis. The role of various factors as potential mediators and moderators eSMHP effectiveness will be explored.

However, the studies regarding time perception have been few as compared to those of neuropsychological measures and there is no information about this topic in Chinese population. In view of this, we will conduct a study to investigate the clinical and treatment aspects of time perception among children and adolescent with ADHD.

Specific Aims:

1. to examine the developmental and gender effect on the performance in time perception;
2. to explore the deficit in time estimation, time discrimination, and time reproduction in children and adolescents with ADHD as compared to normal controls;
3. to identify the association between ADHD symptoms and performance in time perception tasks; and
4. to investigate the efficacy of MPH on the time perception measures among children and adolescents with ADHD; Subjects and Methods: This protocol consists of two studies. First, we will recruit 100 patients with DSM-IV ADHD, aged 9 to 16 years, and 100 school controls. They and their parents will receive K-SADS-E interviews. All of them will have complete assessments of time estimation, time discrimination, and time reproduction. Their parents also report on SNAP-IV and CPRS-R:S. The 2nd assessments will be performed 3 months later after the subjects received treatment at outpatients.

Therefore, cognitive training is often proposed as an intervention for ADHD that targets cognitive deficits, with specific exercises through intensive training sessions. This intervention is based on principles of brain plasticity and cerebral functional reorganizations.

Working memory deficits constitute a key impairment in ADHD. That is why, Cogmed working memory training is the most commonly used and studied cognitive training program in clinical practice and research. It is clear from most studies that Cogmed training program increases working memory in ADHD. However, transfer of learning is not demonstrated on: other cognitive functions that are not targeted by the program, on ADHD symptoms, nor on academic achievement.

In addition to this type of intervention multi-factorial program targeting different cognitive function as Presco also exist but have been less studied.

To address these challenges, this study will follow a randomized and controlled design.

The main objective of this study is to examine the impact of cognitive training in comparison with a control waiting-list group among children with ADHD on:

1. ADHD symptoms,
2. cognitive functioning,
3. attentional capacities
4. academic achievement.

The second objective is to compare two types of cognitive training a unifactorial program Cogmed targeting working memory and a multifactorial Presco focusing on different cognitive functions affected by ADHD.

Long-term effects are examined six months after training. Participants (n=90) will be randomly assigned to the two experimental group (Cogmed or Presco) or to the control group waiting list. Participants will be evaluated three time (time 1) just before the intervention, (time 2) six weeks after the first evaluation, immediately after the intervention and (time 3) six months after the intervention.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),BEHAVIORAL: Cogmed|BEHAVIORAL: Presco,Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris,,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2016-01

Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that serotonergic neurotransmission may, in addition to dopamine, play an important role in the aetiology of ADHD.

Following the research and development phases, we aim to kick off the utilisation of Pai.ACT by (1) pilot-testing its feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy in improving mental health outcomes for parents of children with special needs and (2) researching to determine the most optimal service model for parents by exploring their perceptions through focus group interviews. Pai.ACT offers accessible and comprehensive mental health services to all Chinese-speaking parents, addressing their psychological burden in caring for children with special needs.

NCT01096953,Telepsychiatry in Rural Youth,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01096953,WITHDRAWN,"1. It is difficult to offer kids who live in rural areas good psychiatric care. There are only about 7000 psychiatrists for kids (pediatric psychiatrists) in the entire country. When adding nurse practitioners who specialize in mental health care for children, there still are not enough for everyone who needs care. This means either delays in treatment or no treatment at all by these important specialists. The purpose of this study is to explore how the investigators might offer psychiatric care to kids who live in rural areas through the use of telepsychiatry (TP), specifically those with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

   TP is a way for a physician to talk to someone in a remote area using a computer. The investigators will split the subjects into two study groups. As subjects are identified, they will be assigned a screening number according to a randomization table. The investigators will use TP for one group and face-to-face (F2F) care for the other group. The computer will allow the physician to look at and talk with the child and their parent(s). The investigators would like to know if TP is as good as, or nearly as good as F2F care, so the only difference in treatment approach between the two groups will be whether the subject is receiving treatment through TP or F2F care. Treatment is standardized using a flow chart called the Children's Medication Algorithm Project (CMAP) algorithm. The CMAP algorithm is a guideline established by a large number of experts who have agreed on the best approach to treatment based on scientific evidence. If TP proves as good as F2F care, it would help many parents and their children who do not live in or near a large city.
2. The investigators will find study subjects when parents seek care at clinics in rural Oregon. The physicians in those locations will be aware of the study and will tell us when they think someone needs specialized mental health professional (either a pediatric psychiatrist or nurse practitioner with extensive experience in pediatric mental health). The investigators will make sure that ADHD is the right diagnosis using special exams that have been well-tested to show that they are reliable.
3. The first visit-the intake visit-will probably take about an hour. At that visit, mental health professional will determine whether or not the patient is a candidate for the study. If the patient agrees, they will be asked to sign consent and child assent. The parent and child will then be given an exam that will confirm the diagnosis of ADHD. If confirmed, subjects will then learn if they have been assigned to the TP group or the F2F group and will be assigned to the treating mental health professional. In addition to the DISC, after consent the parent will be given several study instruments to take home with them. They will take about an hour altogether to complete.

   The first visit with the treating mental health professional will take about one hour and the three following visits will take about 30 minutes each. These visits will be about six weeks apart. At the third follow-up visit-the final visit-the parents will be again asked to complete the instruments they completed after consent and will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire that will give them the opportunity to describe their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the treatment and care they received.

   Teachers will be asked to complete the Conner's 10-Item Global Index for the subject twice over the course of the study. The parent of the subject will present the scale to the teacher and retrieve the scale in a sealed envelope to return to the clinic.
4. The diagnosis for ADHD will be made using an exam called the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV (DISC IV). This is a 90-minute exam that is done with a computer that helps you know what questions to ask and helps record the responses. The parents will also be asked to complete a few instruments and surveys that help us understand how well treatment is working. The investigators expect these exams to take about half an hour to complete. They contain questions about the subject's behavior and are completed by parents, except one brief instrument that the investigators will ask and teachers to complete before each follow-up visit. These instruments take about 10 minutes each to complete.
5. This is an initial ""pilot"" study, so the information collected will mainly offer a better understanding of whether or not a larger study is possible. The investigators will look at how many subjects stayed in the study or dropped out and when they dropped out. The investigators will also look at the exams, scoring them to help us understand if those who were part of the TP group did as well, or nearly as well, as those in the F2F group.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,BEHAVIORAL: Mental health care implemented by telepsychiatry|BEHAVIORAL: Face-to-face care,Oregon Health and Science University,,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: OTHER,2010-04
